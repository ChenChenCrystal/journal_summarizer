    "title": "SPIRAL: Self-Play on Zero-Sum Games Incentivizes Reasoning via Multi-Agent Multi-Turn Reinforcement Learning",
    "abstract": "Recent advances in reinforcement learning have shown that language models can develop sophisticated reasoning through training on tasks with verifiable rewards, but these approaches depend on human-curated problem-answer pairs and domain-specific reward engineering. We introduce SPIRAL, a self-play framework where models learn by playing multi-turn, zero-sum games against continuously improving versions of themselves, eliminating the need for human supervision. Through self-play, SPIRAL generates an infinite curriculum of progressively challenging problems as models must constantly adapt to stronger opponents. To enable this self-play training at scale, We implement a fully online, multi-turn, multi-agent reinforcement learning system for LLMs and propose role-conditioned advantage estimation (RAE) to stabilize multi-agent training. Using SPIRAL, self-play on zero-sum games produces reasoning capabilities that transfer broadly. Training Qwen3-4B-Base on Kuhn Poker alone achieves 8.6% improvement on math and 8.4% on general reasoning, outperforming SFT on 25,000 expert game trajectories. Analysis reveals that this transfer occurs through three cognitive patterns: systematic decomposition, expected value calculation, and case-by-case analysis. Multi-game training (TicTacToe, Kuhn Poker, Simple Negotiation) further enhances performance as each game develops distinct reasoning strengths. Applying SPIRAL to a strong reasoning model (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B) can still lead to 2.0% average improvement. These results demonstrate that zero-sum games naturally develop transferable reasoning capabilities, highlighting a promising direction for autonomous reasoning development.",

    "title": "Constructing Non-Markovian Decision Process via History Aggregator",
    "abstract": "In the domain of algorithmic decision-making, non-Markovian dynamics manifest as a significant impediment, especially for paradigms such as Reinforcement Learning (RL), thereby exerting far-reaching consequences on the advancement and effectiveness of the associated systems. Nevertheless, the existing benchmarks are deficient in comprehensively assessing the capacity of decision algorithms to handle non-Markovian dynamics. To address this deficiency, we have devised a generalized methodology grounded in category theory. Notably, we established the category of Markov Decision Processes (MDP) and the category of non-Markovian Decision Processes (NMDP), and proved the equivalence relationship between them. This theoretical foundation provides a novel perspective for understanding and addressing non-Markovian dynamics. We further introduced non-Markovianity into decision-making problem settings via the History Aggregator for State (HAS). With HAS, we can precisely control the state dependency structure of decision-making problems in the time series. Our analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in representing a broad range of non-Markovian dynamics. This approach facilitates a more rigorous and flexible evaluation of decision algorithms by testing them in problem settings where non-Markovian dynamics are explicitly constructed.",

    "abstract": "Resilience non-equilibrium measurement, the ability to maintain fundamental functionality amidst failures and errors, is crucial for scientific management and engineering applications of industrial chain. The problem is particularly challenging when the number or types of multiple co-evolution of resilience (for example, randomly placed) are extremely chaos. Existing end-to-end deep learning ordinarily do not generalize well to unseen full-feld reconstruction of spatiotemporal co-evolution structure, and predict resilience of network topology, especially in multiple chaos data regimes typically seen in real-world applications. To address this challenge, here we propose industrial brain, a human-like autonomous cognitive decision-making and planning framework integrating higher-order activity-driven neuro network and CT-OODA symbolic reasoning to autonomous plan resilience directly from observational data of global variable. The industrial brain not only understands and model structure of node activity dynamics and network co-evolution topology without simplifying assumptions, and reveal the underlying laws hidden behind complex networks, but also enabling accurate resilience prediction, inference, and planning. Experimental results show that industrial brain significantly outperforms resilience prediction and planning methods, with an accurate improvement of up to 10.8\\% over GoT and OlaGPT framework and 11.03\\% over spectral dimension reduction. It also generalizes to unseen topologies and dynamics and maintains robust performance despite observational disturbances.

We manually procure a representative set of graduate-level homework and doctoral qualification-exam problems and test LLMs' abilities to solve them. We further leverage SimOpt, an open-source library of simulation-optimization problems and solvers, to investigate LLMs' abilities to make real-world decisions under uncertainty. Our results show that, though a nontrivial amount of work is still needed to reliably automate the stochastic modeling pipeline in reality, state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate proficiency on par with human experts in both classroom and practical settings. These findings highlight the potential of building AI agents that assist OR researchers and amplify the real-world impact of OR through automation.",

Despite the major advances of AI systems in areas such as math and science, especially since the introduction of transformer architectures, it is well-documented that even the most advanced frontier systems regularly and consistently falter on easily-solvable deductive reasoning tasks. Hence, these systems are unfit to fulfill the dream of achieving artificial general intelligence capable of sound deductive reasoning. We argue that their unsound behavior is a consequence of the statistical learning approach powering their development. To overcome this, we contend that to achieve reliable deductive reasoning in learning-based AI systems, researchers must fundamentally shift from optimizing for statistical performance against distributions on reasoning problems and algorithmic tasks to embracing the more ambitious exact learning paradigm, which demands correctness on all inputs. We argue that exact learning is both essential and possible, and that this ambitious objective should guide algorithm design.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have catalyzed the rise of autonomous AI agents capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting in dynamic, open-ended environments. These large-model agents mark a paradigm shift from static inference systems to interactive, memory-augmented entities. While these capabilities significantly expand the functional scope of AI, they also introduce qualitatively novel security risks - such as memory poisoning, tool misuse, reward hacking, and emergent misalignment - that extend beyond the threat models of conventional systems or standalone LLMs. In this survey, we first examine the structural foundations and key capabilities that underpin increasing levels of agent autonomy, including long-term memory retention, modular tool use, recursive planning, and reflective reasoning. We then analyze the corresponding security vulnerabilities across the agent stack, identifying failure modes such as deferred decision hazards, irreversible tool chains, and deceptive behaviors arising from internal state drift or value misalignment. These risks are traced to architectural fragilities that emerge across perception, cognition, memory, and action modules. To address these challenges, we systematically review recent defense strategies deployed at different autonomy layers, including input sanitization, memory lifecycle control, constrained decision-making, structured tool invocation, and introspective reflection. We introduce the Reflective Risk-Aware Agent Architecture (R2A2), a unified cognitive framework grounded in Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs), which incorporates risk-aware world modeling, meta-policy adaptation, and joint reward-risk optimization to enable principled, proactive safety across the agent's decision-making loop.",

While solving MAPF optimally has been proven to be NP-hard, scalable, and efficient, solvers are vital for real-world applications like logistics, search-and-rescue, etc. To this end, decentralized suboptimal MAPF solvers that leverage machine learning have come on stage. Building on the success of the recently introduced MAPF-GPT, a pure imitation learning solver, we introduce MAPF-GPT-DDG. This novel approach effectively fine-tunes the pre-trained MAPF model using centralized expert data. Leveraging a novel delta-data generation mechanism, MAPF-GPT-DDG accelerates training while significantly improving performance at test time. Our experiments demonstrate that MAPF-GPT-DDG surpasses all existing learning-based MAPF solvers, including the original MAPF-GPT, regarding solution quality across many testing scenarios. Remarkably, it can work with MAPF instances involving up to 1 million agents in a single environment, setting a new milestone for scalability in MAPF domains.",

When solving a conjunction of word equations in this way, the performance of the solver will depend considerably on the order in which equations are processed. In this work, the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for ranking word equations before and during the solving process is explored. For this, a novel graph-based representation for word equations is presented, preserving global information across conjuncts, enabling the GNN to have a holistic view during ranking. To handle the variable number of conjuncts, three approaches to adapt a multi-classification task to the problem of ranking equations are proposed. The training of the GNN is done with the help of minimum unsatisfiable subsets (MUSes) of word equations. The experimental results show that, compared to state-of-the-art string solvers, the new framework solves more problems in benchmarks where each variable appears at most once in each equation.",

While data-driven control takes up recent developments in AI to improve control systems, control theory in general could be leveraged to improve AI safety. Therefore, this article outlines a new perspective on AI safety based on an interdisciplinary interpretation of the underlying data-generation process and the respective abstraction by AI systems in a system theory-inspired and system analysis-driven manner. In this context, the new perspective, also referred to as data control, aims to stimulate AI engineering to take advantage of existing safety analysis and assurance in an interdisciplinary way to drive the paradigm of data control. Following a top-down approach, a generic foundation for safety analysis and assurance is outlined at an abstract level that can be refined for specific AI systems and applications and is prepared for future innovation.",

Furthermore, we find that a model's battle performance correlates strongly with its LLM Arena score on language-related tasks, indicating a meaningful link between linguistic ability and strategic reasoning.

Current pathology domain adaptation methods focus on image patches rather than WSI, thus failing to capture global WSI features required in typical clinical scenarios.

HASD achieves multi-scale feature consistency and computationally efficient slide-level domain adaptation through two key components: (1) a hierarchical adaptation framework that integrates a Domain-level Alignment Solver for feature alignment, a Slide-level Geometric Invariance Regularization to preserve the morphological structure, and a Patch-level Attention Consistency Regularization to maintain local critical diagnostic cues; and (2) a prototype selection mechanism that reduces computational overhead. We validate our method on two slide-level tasks across five datasets, achieving a 4.1\\% AUROC improvement in a Breast Cancer HER2 Grading cohort and a 3.9\\% C-index gain in a UCEC survival prediction cohort.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) in games has gained significant momentum in recent years, enabling the creation of different agent behaviors that can transform a player's gaming experience. However, deploying RL agents in production environments presents two key challenges: (1) designing an effective reward function typically requires an RL expert, and (2) when a game's content or mechanics are modified, previously tuned reward weights may no longer be optimal. Towards the latter challenge, we propose an automated approach for iteratively fine-tuning an RL agent's reward function weights, based on a user-defined language based behavioral goal. A Language Model (LM) proposes updated weights at each iteration based on this target behavior and a summary of performance statistics from prior training rounds. This closed-loop process allows the LM to self-correct and refine its output over time, producing increasingly aligned behavior without the need for manual reward engineering. We evaluate our approach in a racing task and show that it consistently improves agent performance across iterations. The LM-guided agents show a significant increase in performance from $9\\%$ to $74\\%$ success rate in just one iteration. We compare our LM-guided tuning against a human expert's manual weight design in the racing task: by the final iteration, the LM-tuned agent achieved an $80\\%$ success rate, and completed laps in an average of $855$ time steps, a competitive performance against the expert-tuned agent's peak $94\\%$ success, and $850$ time steps.",

However, existing MLLM benchmarks often fall short in precisely and comprehensively evaluating long-chain reasoning abilities from three key aspects: (1) lack of difficulty and diversity, (2) susceptibility to guessability and memorization, (3) inadequate assessment of intermediate reasoning steps. To fill this gap, we introduce MMReason, a new benchmark designed to precisely and comprehensively evaluate MLLM long-chain reasoning capability with diverse, open-ended, challenging questions. First, we curate challenging questions requiring multi-step reasoning from various fields (i.e., 6 disciplines) and multiple difficulty levels (i.e., from pre-university to university, and from foundational to competition tiers). Second, these questions are reformulated into an open-ended format and filtered using a multi-model voting technique to eliminate shortcut cases related to guessing and memorization, ensuring robust reasoning evaluations. Third, we annotate the questions with detailed step-by-step solutions, and design a reference-based ternary scoring mechanism to reliably assess intermediate reasoning steps. With MMReason, we benchmark popular leading MLLMs and provide an in-depth analysis of their reasoning capabilities.

Trained on interaction trajectories collected from diverse pairs of agents with complementary behaviors, CooT quickly learns effective coordination strategies without explicit supervision or fine-tuning. Evaluations on the Overcooked benchmark demonstrate that CooT significantly outperforms baseline methods in coordination tasks involving previously unseen partners.

These traditional methods only focus on demand and price which leads to insufficient analysis of data. To address this issue, using the hybrid approach, which focuses on external variables that also effect the predicted prices.

We further introduce two principled evaluation metrics--Honesty Score (H-Score) and Ethical Confidence Index (ECI)--to benchmark alignment between confidence, accuracy, and ethical communication. Empirically, HonestVQA improves DocVQA accuracy by up to 4.3% and F1 by 4.3% across SpDocVQA, InfographicsVQA, and SROIE datasets. It reduces overconfidence, lowering H-Score and ECI by 0.072 and 0.078, respectively. In cross domain evaluation, it achieves up to 78.9% accuracy and 76.1% F1-score, demonstrating strong generalization. Ablation shows a 3.8% drop in accuracy without alignment or contrastive loss.",

    "title": "GATSim: Urban Mobility Simulation with Generative Agents",
    "abstract": "Traditional agent-based urban mobility simulations rely on rigid rule-based systems that fail to capture the complexity, adaptability, and behavioral diversity characteristic of human travel decision-making. Recent advances in large language models and AI agent technology offer opportunities to create agents with reasoning capabilities, persistent memory, and adaptive learning mechanisms. We propose GATSim (Generative-Agent Transport Simulation), a novel framework that leverages these advances to create generative agents with rich behavioral characteristics for urban mobility simulation. Unlike conventional approaches, GATSim agents possess diverse socioeconomic attributes, individual lifestyles, and evolving preferences that shape their mobility decisions through psychologically-informed memory systems, tool usage capabilities, and lifelong learning mechanisms. The main contributions of this study include: (1) a comprehensive architecture combining an urban mobility foundation model with agent cognitive systems and transport simulation environment, (2) a fully functional prototype implementation, and (3) systematic validation demonstrating that generative agents produce believable travel behaviors. Through designed reflection processes, generative agents in this study can transform specific travel experiences into generalized insights, enabling realistic behavioral adaptation over time with specialized mechanisms for activity planning and real-time reactive behaviors tailored to urban mobility contexts. Experiments show that generative agents perform competitively with human annotators in mobility scenarios while naturally producing macroscopic traffic evolution patterns.

    "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents, understanding their cooperation and social mechanisms is becoming increasingly important. In particular, how LLMs balance self-interest and collective well-being is a critical challenge for ensuring alignment, robustness, and safe deployment. In this paper, we examine the challenge of costly sanctioning in multi-agent LLM systems, where an agent must decide whether to invest its own resources to incentivize cooperation or penalize defection. To study this, we adapt a public goods game with institutional choice from behavioral economics, allowing us to observe how different LLMs navigate social dilemmas over repeated interactions. Our analysis reveals four distinct behavioral patterns among models: some consistently establish and sustain high levels of cooperation, others fluctuate between engagement and disengagement, some gradually decline in cooperative behavior over time, and others rigidly follow fixed strategies regardless of outcomes. Surprisingly, we find that reasoning LLMs, such as the o1 series, struggle significantly with cooperation, whereas some traditional LLMs consistently achieve high levels of cooperation. These findings suggest that the current approach to improving LLMs, which focuses on enhancing their reasoning capabilities, does not necessarily lead to cooperation, providing valuable insights for deploying LLM agents in environments that require sustained collaboration.

In the context of data analysis, particularly within Formal Concept Analysis (FCA), lattices are often observed to exhibit a high degree of distributivity. However, no standardized measure exists to quantify this property. In this paper, we introduce the notion of rises in (concept) lattices as a means to assess distributivity. Rises capture how the number of attributes or objects in covering concepts change within the concept lattice. We show that a lattice is distributive if and only if no non-unit rises occur. Furthermore, we relate rises to the classical notion of meet- and join distributivity. We observe that concept lattices from real-world data are to a high degree join-distributive, but much less meet-distributive.

    "title": "Context-Driven Knowledge Graph Completion with Semantic-Aware Relational Message Passing",
    "abstract": "Semantic context surrounding a triplet $(h, r, t)$ is crucial for Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC), providing vital cues for prediction. However, traditional node-based message passing mechanisms, when applied to knowledge graphs, often introduce noise and suffer from information dilution or over-smoothing by indiscriminately aggregating information from all neighboring edges. To address this challenge, we propose a semantic-aware relational message passing. A core innovation of this framework is the introduction of a \\textbf{semantic-aware Top-K neighbor selection strategy}. Specifically, this strategy first evaluates the semantic relevance between a central node and its incident edges within a shared latent space, selecting only the Top-K most pertinent ones. Subsequently, information from these selected edges is effectively fused with the central node's own representation using a \\textbf{multi-head attention aggregator} to generate a semantically focused node message. In this manner, our model not only leverages the structure and features of edges within the knowledge graph but also more accurately captures and propagates the contextual information most relevant to the specific link prediction task, thereby effectively mitigating interference from irrelevant information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to existing approaches on several established benchmarks.",

Our experiments reveal that DeepSeek-R1 consistently achieves the highest F1-scores across multiple tasks and problem sizes, demonstrating strong aptitude in logical deduction and relational inference.

However, as their use grows, concerns have emerged regarding their reliability in simulating complex decision-making behavior, such as risky decision-making, where a single choice can lead to multiple outcomes. This study investigates the ability of LLMs to simulate risky decision-making scenarios. We compare model-generated decisions with actual human responses in a series of lottery-based tasks, using transportation stated preference survey data from participants in Sydney, Dhaka, Hong Kong, and Nanjing. Demographic inputs were provided to two LLMs -- ChatGPT 4o and ChatGPT o1-mini -- which were tasked with predicting individual choices. Risk preferences were analyzed using the Constant Relative Risk Aversion (CRRA) framework. Results show that both models exhibit more risk-averse behavior than human participants, with o1-mini aligning more closely with observed human decisions. Further analysis of multilingual data from Nanjing and Hong Kong indicates that model predictions in Chinese deviate more from actual responses compared to English, suggesting that prompt language may influence simulation performance. These findings highlight both the promise and the current limitations of LLMs in replicating human-like risk behavior, particularly in linguistic and cultural settings.",

We posit that AI is advancing through distinct epochs, each defined by a revolutionary shift in its capacity for representation and reasoning, analogous to the inventions of cuneiform, the alphabet, grammar and logic, mathematical calculus, and formal logical systems. This \"Geometry of Cognition\" framework moves beyond mere metaphor to provide a systematic, cross-disciplinary model that not only explains AI's past architectural shifts-from expert systems to Transformers-but also charts a concrete and prescriptive path forward. Crucially, we demonstrate that this evolution is not merely linear but reflexive: as AI advances through these stages, the tools and insights it develops create a feedback loop that fundamentally reshapes its own underlying architecture. We are currently transitioning into a \"Metalinguistic Moment,\" characterized by the emergence of self-reflective capabilities like Chain-of-Thought prompting and Constitutional AI. The subsequent stages, the \"Mathematical Symbolism Moment\" and the \"Formal Logic System Moment,\" will be defined by the development of a computable calculus of thought, likely through neuro-symbolic architectures and program synthesis, culminating in provably aligned and reliable AI that reconstructs its own foundational representations.

Thus, complex reasoning remains poorly understood in multimodal domains. Here, we present MARBLE, a challenging multimodal reasoning benchmark that is designed to scrutinize multimodal language models (MLLMs) in their ability to carefully reason step-by-step through complex multimodal problems and environments. MARBLE is composed of two highly challenging tasks, M-Portal and M-Cube, that require the crafting and understanding of multistep plans under spatial, visual, and physical constraints. We find that current MLLMs perform poorly on MARBLE -- all the 12 advanced models obtain near-random performance on M-Portal and 0% accuracy on M-Cube. Only in simplified subtasks some models outperform the random baseline, indicating that complex reasoning is still a challenge for existing MLLMs. Moreover, we show that perception remains a bottleneck, where MLLMs occasionally fail to extract information from the visual inputs. By shedding a light on the limitations of MLLMs, we hope that MARBLE will spur the development of the next generation of models with the ability to reason and plan across many, multimodal reasoning steps.",

At larger batch sizes, Hecto exhibits improved performance, benefiting from relaxed computational constraints that allow its heterogeneous architecture to optimize more effectively. Ablation results isolate architectural diversity as the source of Hecto's stability and interpretability across diverse reasoning tasks.

While other technologies may also pose substantial risks, AI's pervasive reach makes its societal effects especially profound.

To mitigate the risks that arise, several theoretical tools and guidelines have been developed, alongside efforts to create technological tools aimed at safeguarding Trustworthy AI. The guidelines take a more holistic view of the issue but fail to provide techniques for quantifying trustworthiness. Conversely, while technological tools are better at achieving such quantification, they lack a holistic perspective, focusing instead on specific aspects of Trustworthy AI.

    "abstract": "Data selection plays a crucial role in data-driven decision-making, including in large language models (LLMs), and is typically task-dependent. Properties such as data quality and diversity have been extensively studied and are known to enhance model performance. However, it remains unclear whether there exist other quantitative and general principles of data selection that can consistently improve performance, especially for complex tasks with limited prior knowledge. In this paper, we demonstrate that selecting more uniformly distributed data can improve training efficiency while enhancing performance. Specifically, we establish that more uniform (less biased) distribution leads to a larger minimum pairwise distance between data points, denoted by $h_{\\min}$, and prove that a smaller $h_{\\min}$ can slow down the training dynamics of gradient descent (GD). Moreover, we theoretically show that the approximation error of neural networks decreases as $h_{\\min}$ increases. Our analysis introduces a convergence framework for GD beyond the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) regime, applicable to a broad class of architectures, including transformers, without requiring Lipschitz smoothness. This framework further provides theoretical justification for the use of residual connections and function compositions in deep neural architectures. In the end, we conduct comprehensive experiments for supervised fine-tuning across various settings, including different optimization strategies, model sizes, and training datasets. The results consistently demonstrate that selecting data by maximizing pairwise distance significantly accelerates training and achieves comparable or better performance in LLMs across diverse datasets.

By learning a scheduling policy, our method addresses the temperamental behavior of CFG. Empirical results demonstrate that our guidance scheduler significantly enhances image quality and alignment with the text prompt, advancing the performance of text-to-image generation.

    "abstract": "We show that a language model's ability to predict text is tightly linked to the breadth of its embedding space: models that spread their contextual representations more widely tend to achieve lower perplexity. Concretely, we find that representation dispersion - the average pairwise cosine distance among hidden vectors - strongly and negatively correlates with perplexity across diverse model families (LLaMA, Qwen, and others) and domains (Wikipedia, news, scientific abstracts). Beyond illustrating this link, we show how dispersion can be leveraged for a range of practical tasks without requiring labeled data. First, measuring dispersion on unlabeled text allows us to predict downstream accuracy in new domains, offering a data-efficient tool for model selection. Next, we find that identifying layers with higher dispersion pinpoints the best representations for retrieval-based methods such as kNN-LM, bypassing exhaustive layer-by-layer searches. Finally, we integrate a simple push-away objective into training, which increases dispersion in both single-domain and cross-domain scenarios and directly improves perplexity in each.",

    "title": "Development of Hybrid Artificial Intelligence Training on Real and Synthetic Data: Benchmark on Two Mixed Training Strategies",
    "abstract": "Synthetic data has emerged as a cost-effective alternative to real data for training artificial neural networks (ANN). However, the disparity between synthetic and real data results in a domain gap. That gap leads to poor performance and generalization of the trained ANN when applied to real-world scenarios. Several strategies have been developed to bridge this gap, which combine synthetic and real data, known as mixed training using hybrid datasets. While these strategies have been shown to mitigate the domain gap, a systematic evaluation of their generalizability and robustness across various tasks and architectures remains underexplored. To address this challenge, our study comprehensively analyzes two widely used mixing strategies on three prevalent architectures and three distinct hybrid datasets. From these datasets, we sample subsets with varying proportions of synthetic to real data to investigate the impact of synthetic and real components. The findings of this paper provide valuable insights into optimizing the use of synthetic data in the training process of any ANN, contributing to enhancing robustness and efficacy.",
