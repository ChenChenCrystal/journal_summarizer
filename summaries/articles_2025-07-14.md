## Push or Light: Nudging Standing to Break Prolonged Sitting
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08659

**Abstract:** Prolonged sitting is a health risk leading to metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. To combat this, various "nudging" strategies encourage stand-ups. Behavior change triggers use explicit prompts such as smartphone push notifications or light controls. However, comparisons of the effects of such interactions, discomfort, and user context have not yet been performed. The present study evaluated these methods in a mixed design experiment with 15 college students. Three intervention methods (none, push notifications, and light dimming) and three user task contexts (computer work, video calls, and reading) were tested. The frequency of standing up and comfort were assessed after each ten-minute session. Results showed that dimming resulted in slightly more breaks (1.4 \pm 1.55) than push notification (1.2 \pm 1.08), but caused discomfort for 66.7% of participants, compared to 20% for notification. The results were influenced by task context. Dimming was most effective during video calls and reading, while push notifications were more effective during computer work. These findings suggest adaptive nudging systems should tailor interventions based on context and individual preferences.

**AI Summary:** This study compared the effectiveness of push notifications and light dimming as nudging strategies to encourage standing up and breaking prolonged sitting. Results showed that light dimming led to slightly more breaks but caused more discomfort compared to push notifications. The effectiveness of each method varied depending on the user task context, suggesting that adaptive nudging systems should consider individual preferences and context when designing interventions.

## Do Conversational Interfaces Limit Creativity? Exploring Visual Graph Systems for Creative Writing
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08260

**Abstract:** We present a graphical, node-based system through which users can visually chain generative AI models for creative tasks. Research in the area of chaining LLMs has found that while chaining provides transparency, controllability and guardrails to approach certain tasks, chaining with pre-defined LLM steps prevents free exploration. Using cognitive processes from creativity research as a basis, we create a system that addresses the inherent constraints of chat-based AI interactions. Specifically, our system aims to overcome the limiting linear structure that inhibits creative exploration and ideation. Further, our node-based approach enables the creation of reusable, shareable templates that can address different creative tasks. In a small-scale user study, we find that our graph-based system supports ideation and allows some users to better visualise and think through their writing process when compared to a similar conversational interface. We further discuss the weaknesses and limitations of our system, noting the benefits to creativity that user interfaces with higher complexity can provide for users who can effectively use them.

**AI Summary:** The research explores the limitations of conversational interfaces in creative writing tasks and presents a graphical, node-based system for chaining generative AI models.

## Emotion Detection in Older Adults Using Physiological Signals from Wearable Sensors
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08167

**Abstract:** Emotion detection in older adults is crucial for understanding their cognitive and emotional well-being, especially in hospital and assisted living environments. In this work, we investigate an edge-based, non-obtrusive approach to emotion identification that uses only physiological signals obtained via wearable sensors. Our dataset includes data from 40 older individuals. Emotional states were obtained using physiological signals from the Empatica E4 and Shimmer3 GSR+ wristband and facial expressions were recorded using camera-based emotion recognition with the iMotion's Facial Expression Analysis (FEA) module. The dataset also contains twelve emotion categories in terms of relative intensities. We aim to study how well emotion recognition can be accomplished using simply physiological sensor data, without the requirement for cameras or intrusive facial analysis. By leveraging classical machine learning models, we predict the intensity of emotional responses based on physiological signals. We achieved the highest 0.782 r2 score with the lowest 0.0006 MSE on the regression task. This method has significant implications for individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementia (ADRD), as well as veterans coping with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) or other cognitive impairments. Our results across multiple classical regression models validate the feasibility of this method, paving the way for privacy-preserving and efficient emotion recognition systems in real-world settings.

**AI Summary:** This research explores a non-intrusive approach to emotion detection in older adults using physiological signals from wearable sensors. By analyzing data from 40 older individuals, the study found that emotion recognition based solely on physiological signals is feasible, with high accuracy achieved using classical machine learning models. This method has significant implications for individuals with cognitive impairments such as Alzheimer's Disease and PTSD, paving the way for privacy-preserving and efficient emotion recognition systems in real-world settings.

## SSSUMO: Real-Time Semi-Supervised Submovement Decomposition
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08028

**Abstract:** This paper introduces a SSSUMO, semi-supervised deep learning approach for submovement decomposition that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and speed. While submovement analysis offers valuable insights into motor control, existing methods struggle with reconstruction accuracy, computational cost, and validation, due to the difficulty of obtaining hand-labeled data. We address these challenges using a semi-supervised learning framework. This framework learns from synthetic data, initially generated from minimum-jerk principles and then iteratively refined through adaptation to unlabeled human movement data. Our fully convolutional architecture with differentiable reconstruction significantly surpasses existing methods on both synthetic and diverse human motion datasets, demonstrating robustness even in high-noise conditions. Crucially, the model operates in real-time (less than a millisecond per input second), a substantial improvement over optimization-based techniques. This enhanced performance facilitates new applications in human-computer interaction, rehabilitation medicine, and motor control studies. We demonstrate the model's effectiveness across diverse human-performed tasks such as steering, rotation, pointing, object moving, handwriting, and mouse-controlled gaming, showing notable improvements particularly on challenging datasets where traditional methods largely fail. Training and benchmarking source code, along with pre-trained model weights, are made publicly available at this https URL.

## A Versatile Dataset of Mouse and Eye Movements on Search Engine Results Pages
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08003

**Abstract:** We contribute a comprehensive dataset to study user attention and purchasing behavior on Search Engine Result Pages (SERPs). Previous work has relied on mouse movements as a low-cost large-scale behavioral proxy but also has relied on self-reported ground-truth labels, collected at post-task, which can be inaccurate and prone to biases. To address this limitation, we use an eye tracker to construct an objective ground-truth of continuous visual attention. Our dataset comprises 2,776 transactional queries on Google SERPs, collected from 47 participants, and includes: (1) HTML source files, with CSS and images; (2) rendered SERP screenshots; (3) eye movement data; (4) mouse movement data; (5) bounding boxes of direct display and organic advertisements; and (6) scripts for further preprocessing the data. In this paper we provide an overview of the dataset and baseline experiments (classification tasks) that can inspire researchers about the different possibilities for future work.

**AI Summary:** This research presents a dataset that combines eye tracking and mouse movement data to study user attention and purchasing behavior on Search Engine Result Pages (SERPs). By using eye tracking as an objective measure of visual attention, the dataset provides more accurate insights compared to previous studies relying on self-reported labels. The dataset includes various components such as HTML source files, eye movement data, and scripts for data preprocessing, offering a valuable resource for researchers to explore different research possibilities in this area.

## Human vs. LLM-Based Thematic Analysis for Digital Mental Health Research: Proof-of-Concept Comparative Study
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08002

**Abstract:** Thematic analysis provides valuable insights into participants' experiences through coding and theme development, but its resource-intensive nature limits its use in large healthcare studies. Large language models (LLMs) can analyze text at scale and identify key content automatically, potentially addressing these challenges. However, their application in mental health interviews needs comparison with traditional human analysis. This study evaluates out-of-the-box and knowledge-base LLM-based thematic analysis against traditional methods using transcripts from a stress-reduction trial with healthcare workers. OpenAI's GPT-4o model was used along with the Role, Instructions, Steps, End-Goal, Narrowing (RISEN) prompt engineering framework and compared to human analysis in Dedoose. Each approach developed codes, noted saturation points, applied codes to excerpts for a subset of participants (n = 20), and synthesized data into themes. Outputs and performance metrics were compared directly. LLMs using the RISEN framework developed deductive parent codes similar to human codes, but humans excelled in inductive child code development and theme synthesis. Knowledge-based LLMs reached coding saturation with fewer transcripts (10-15) than the out-of-the-box model (15-20) and humans (90-99). The out-of-the-box LLM identified a comparable number of excerpts to human researchers, showing strong inter-rater reliability (K = 0.84), though the knowledge-based LLM produced fewer excerpts. Human excerpts were longer and involved multiple codes per excerpt, while LLMs typically applied one code. Overall, LLM-based thematic analysis proved more cost-effective but lacked the depth of human analysis. LLMs can transform qualitative analysis in mental healthcare and clinical research when combined with human oversight to balance participant perspectives and research resources.

**AI Summary:** This study compared the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) with traditional human analysis in thematic analysis of mental health interviews. The LLMs, particularly when using the RISEN framework, were able to develop deductive parent codes similar to human codes and reached coding saturation with fewer transcripts. However, human analysis excelled in inductive child code development and theme synthesis, showing that while LLMs are more cost-effective, they lack the depth of human analysis. Combining LLMs with human oversight can transform qualitative analysis in mental healthcare and clinical research by balancing participant perspectives and research resources.

## NeuralOS: Towards Simulating Operating Systems via Neural Generative Models
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08800

**Abstract:** We introduce NeuralOS, a neural framework that simulates graphical user interfaces (GUIs) of operating systems by directly predicting screen frames in response to user inputs such as mouse movements, clicks, and keyboard events. NeuralOS combines a recurrent neural network (RNN), which tracks computer state, with a diffusion-based neural renderer that generates screen images. The model is trained on a large-scale dataset of Ubuntu XFCE recordings, which include both randomly generated interactions and realistic interactions produced by AI agents. Experiments show that NeuralOS successfully renders realistic GUI sequences, accurately captures mouse interactions, and reliably predicts state transitions like application launches. Although modeling fine-grained keyboard interactions precisely remains challenging, NeuralOS offers a step toward creating fully adaptive, generative neural interfaces for future human-computer interaction systems.

**AI Summary:** The NeuralOS framework uses neural generative models to simulate operating system graphical user interfaces (GUIs) by predicting screen frames in response to user inputs. The model combines a recurrent neural network (RNN) with a diffusion-based neural renderer and is trained on a large dataset of Ubuntu XFCE recordings. While fine-grained keyboard interactions are still challenging to model accurately, NeuralOS shows promise in creating adaptive, generative neural interfaces for future human-computer interaction systems.

## Generating Proto-Personas through Prompt Engineering: A Case Study on Efficiency, Effectiveness and Empathy
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08594

**Abstract:** Proto-personas are commonly used during early-stage Product Discovery, such as Lean Inception, to guide product definition and stakeholder alignment. However, the manual creation of proto-personas is often time-consuming, cognitively demanding, and prone to bias. In this paper, we propose and empirically investigate a prompt engineering-based approach to generate proto-personas with the support of Generative AI (GenAI). Our goal is to evaluate the approach in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, user acceptance, and the empathy elicited by the generated personas. We conducted a case study with 19 participants embedded in a real Lean Inception, employing a qualitative and quantitative methods design. The results reveal the approach's efficiency by reducing time and effort and improving the quality and reusability of personas in later discovery phases, such as Minimum Viable Product (MVP) scoping and feature refinement. While acceptance was generally high, especially regarding perceived usefulness and ease of use, participants noted limitations related to generalization and domain specificity. Furthermore, although cognitive empathy was strongly supported, affective and behavioral empathy varied significantly across participants. These results contribute novel empirical evidence on how GenAI can be effectively integrated into software Product Discovery practices, while also identifying key challenges to be addressed in future iterations of such hybrid design processes.

**AI Summary:** This research paper introduces a prompt engineering-based approach to generate proto-personas with the support of Generative AI, aiming to improve efficiency, effectiveness, and empathy in early-stage product discovery. The study showed that this approach reduced time and effort, improved persona quality and reusability, and was generally well-accepted by participants. However, challenges related to generalization, domain specificity, and varying levels of empathy were identified, highlighting the need for further refinement in integrating AI into software Product Discovery practices.

## Emotion Recognition in Older Adults with Quantum Machine Learning and Wearable Sensors
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08175

**Abstract:** We investigate the feasibility of inferring emotional states exclusively from physiological signals, thereby presenting a privacy-preserving alternative to conventional facial recognition techniques. We conduct a performance comparison of classical machine learning algorithms and hybrid quantum machine learning (QML) methods with a quantum kernel-based model. Our results indicate that the quantum-enhanced SVM surpasses classical counterparts in classification performance across all emotion categories, even when trained on limited datasets. The F1 scores over all classes are over 80% with around a maximum of 36% improvement in the recall values. The integration of wearable sensor data with quantum machine learning not only enhances accuracy and robustness but also facilitates unobtrusive emotion recognition. This methodology holds promise for populations with impaired communication abilities, such as individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) and veterans with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The findings establish an early foundation for passive emotional monitoring in clinical and assisted living conditions.

**AI Summary:** This research explores using wearable sensors and quantum machine learning to recognize emotional states in older adults, offering a privacy-preserving alternative to facial recognition techniques. The study found that the quantum-enhanced SVM model outperformed classical machine learning algorithms in classifying emotions, even with limited training data, with F1 scores over 80% and up to a 36% improvement in recall values. This approach shows promise for passive emotional monitoring in populations with communication impairments, such as individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias and veterans with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.

## A Systematic Analysis of Declining Medical Safety Messaging in Generative AI Models
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08030

**Abstract:** Generative AI models, including large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), are increasingly used to interpret medical images and answer clinical questions. Their responses often include inaccuracies; therefore, safety measures like medical disclaimers are critical to remind users that AI outputs are not professionally vetted or a substitute for medical advice. This study evaluated the presence of disclaimers in LLM and VLM outputs across model generations from 2022 to 2025. Using 500 mammograms, 500 chest X-rays, 500 dermatology images, and 500 medical questions, outputs were screened for disclaimer phrases. Medical disclaimer presence in LLM and VLM outputs dropped from 26.3% in 2022 to 0.97% in 2025, and from 19.6% in 2023 to 1.05% in 2025, respectively. By 2025, the majority of models displayed no disclaimers. As public models become more capable and authoritative, disclaimers must be implemented as a safeguard adapting to the clinical context of each output.

**AI Summary:** This study analyzed the presence of medical disclaimers in outputs generated by generative AI models used for interpreting medical images and answering clinical questions from 2022 to 2025. The research found a significant decline in the inclusion of disclaimers in model outputs over time, with the majority of models by 2025 lacking these important safety measures. The findings highlight the importance of implementing medical disclaimers in AI outputs to remind users that they are not a substitute for professional medical advice and to ensure safety in clinical contexts.

## Conjugated Capabilities: Interrelations of Elementary Human Capabilities and Their Implication on Human-Machine Task Allocation and Capability Testing Procedures
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07560

**Abstract:** Human and automation capabilities are the foundation of every human-autonomy interaction and interaction pattern. Therefore, machines need to understand the capacity and performance of human doing, and adapt their own behavior, accordingly. In this work, we address the concept of conjugated capabilities, i.e. capabilities that are dependent or interrelated and between which effort can be distributed. These may be used to overcome human limitations, by shifting effort from a deficient to a conjugated capability with performative resources. For example: A limited arm's reach may be compensated by tilting the torso forward. We analyze the interrelation between elementary capabilities within the IMBA standard to uncover potential conjugation, and show evidence in data of post-rehabilitation patients. From the conjugated capabilities, within the example application of stationary manufacturing, we create a network of interrelations. With this graph, a manifold of potential uses is enabled. We showcase the graph's usage in optimizing IMBA test design to accelerate data recordings, and discuss implications of conjugated capabilities on task allocation between the human and an autonomy.

**AI Summary:** This research explores the concept of conjugated capabilities, which are interrelated human abilities that can be utilized to overcome limitations. By analyzing the interrelation between elementary capabilities within the IMBA standard, the study demonstrates how effort can be distributed among different capabilities to enhance performance. The findings have implications for human-machine task allocation and capability testing procedures, showing how machines can adapt their behavior based on an understanding of human capabilities.

## ArchiveGPT: A human-centered evaluation of using a vision language model for image cataloguing
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07551

**Abstract:** The accelerating growth of photographic collections has outpaced manual cataloguing, motivating the use of vision language models (VLMs) to automate metadata generation. This study examines whether Al-generated catalogue descriptions can approximate human-written quality and how generative Al might integrate into cataloguing workflows in archival and museum collections. A VLM (InternVL2) generated catalogue descriptions for photographic prints on labelled cardboard mounts with archaeological content, evaluated by archive and archaeology experts and non-experts in a human-centered, experimental framework. Participants classified descriptions as AI-generated or expert-written, rated quality, and reported willingness to use and trust in AI tools. Classification performance was above chance level, with both groups underestimating their ability to detect Al-generated descriptions. OCR errors and hallucinations limited perceived quality, yet descriptions rated higher in accuracy and usefulness were harder to classify, suggesting that human review is necessary to ensure the accuracy and quality of catalogue descriptions generated by the out-of-the-box model, particularly in specialized domains like archaeological cataloguing. Experts showed lower willingness to adopt AI tools, emphasizing concerns on preservation responsibility over technical performance. These findings advocate for a collaborative approach where AI supports draft generation but remains subordinate to human verification, ensuring alignment with curatorial values (e.g., provenance, transparency). The successful integration of this approach depends not only on technical advancements, such as domain-specific fine-tuning, but even more on establishing trust among professionals, which could both be fostered through a transparent and explainable AI pipeline.

**AI Summary:** This study evaluates the use of a vision language model (VLM) called InternVL2 for automating metadata generation in archival and museum collections. The research shows that while VLM-generated catalogue descriptions can approximate human-written quality, human review is necessary to ensure accuracy and quality, especially in specialized domains like archaeological cataloguing. Experts in the field show lower willingness to adopt AI tools, emphasizing the importance of establishing trust among professionals through transparent and explainable AI pipelines.

## FLoRA: An Advanced AI-Powered Engine to Facilitate Hybrid Human-AI Regulated Learning
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07362

**Abstract:** SRL, defined as learners' ability to systematically plan, monitor, and regulate their learning activities, is crucial for sustained academic achievement and lifelong learning competencies. Emerging Artificial Intelligence (AI) developments profoundly influence SRL interactions by potentially either diminishing or strengthening learners' opportunities to exercise their own regulatory skills. Recent literature emphasizes a balanced approach termed Hybrid Human-AI Regulated Learning (HHAIRL), in which AI provides targeted, timely scaffolding while preserving the learners' role as active decision-makers and reflective monitors of their learning process. Nevertheless, existing digital tools frequently fall short, lacking adaptability, focusing narrowly on isolated SRL phases, and insufficiently support meaningful human-AI interactions. In response, this paper introduces the enhanced FLoRA Engine, which incorporates advanced Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) features and state-of-the-art learning analytics, explicitly grounded in SRL and HHAIRL theories. The FLoRA Engine offers instrumentation tools such as collaborative writing, multi-agents chatbot, and detailed learning trace logging to support dynamic, adaptive scaffolding tailored to individual needs in real time. We further present a summary of several research studies that provide the validations for and illustrate how these instrumentation tools can be utilized in real-world educational and experimental contexts. These studies demonstrate the effectiveness of FLoRA Engine in fostering SRL and HHAIRL, providing both theoretical insights and practical solutions for the future of AI-enhanced learning context.

**AI Summary:** The abstract discusses the importance of Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) and the impact of AI on learners' regulatory skills. It introduces the FLoRA Engine, which utilizes advanced AI features and learning analytics to support Hybrid Human-AI Regulated Learning (HHAIRL) by providing adaptive scaffolding tailored to individual needs in real time. The research studies presented validate the effectiveness of the FLoRA Engine in promoting SRL and HHAIRL, offering theoretical insights and practical solutions for the future of AI-enhanced learning contexts.

**Abstract:** The work involved in gathering, wrangling, cleaning, and otherwise preparing data for analysis is often the most time consuming and tedious aspect of data work. Although many studies describe data preparation within the context of data science workflows, there has been little research on data preparation in data journalism. We address this gap with a hybrid form of thematic analysis that combines deductive codes derived from existing accounts of data science workflows and inductive codes arising from an interview study with 36 professional data journalists. We extend a previous model of data science work to incorporate detailed activities of data preparation. We synthesize 60 dirty data issues from 16 taxonomies on dirty data and our interview data, and we provide a novel taxonomy to characterize these dirty data issues as discrepancies between mental models. We also identify four challenges faced by journalists: diachronic, regional, fragmented, and disparate data sources.

**AI Summary:** This research study compares data preparation processes in data science and data journalism, finding that data preparation is a time-consuming and tedious aspect of both fields. The study identifies 60 dirty data issues and categorizes them into a novel taxonomy, highlighting discrepancies between mental models. The research provides valuable insights into the challenges faced by journalists in handling data, such as dealing with diachronic, regional, fragmented, and disparate data sources.

## Can Large Language Models Improve Phishing Defense? A Large-Scale Controlled Experiment on Warning Dialogue Explanations
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07916

**Abstract:** Phishing has become a prominent risk in modern cybersecurity, often used to bypass technological defences by exploiting predictable human behaviour. Warning dialogues are a standard mitigation measure, but the lack of explanatory clarity and static content limits their effectiveness. In this paper, we report on our research to assess the capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate clear, concise, and scalable explanations for phishing warnings. We carried out a large-scale between-subjects user study (N = 750) to compare the influence of warning dialogues supplemented with manually generated explanations against those generated by two LLMs, Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Llama 3.3 70B. We investigated two explanatory styles (feature-based and counterfactual) for their effects on behavioural metrics (click-through rate) and perceptual outcomes (e.g., trust, risk, clarity). The results indicate that well-constructed LLM-generated explanations can equal or surpass manually crafted explanations in reducing susceptibility to phishing; Claude-generated warnings exhibited particularly robust performance. Feature-based explanations were more effective for genuine phishing attempts, whereas counterfactual explanations diminished false-positive rates. Other variables such as workload, gender, and prior familiarity with warning dialogues significantly moderated warning effectiveness. These results indicate that LLMs can be used to automatically build explanations for warning users against phishing, and that such solutions are scalable, adaptive, and consistent with human-centred values.

**AI Summary:** This research explores the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating explanations for phishing warning dialogues. The study found that well-constructed LLM-generated explanations can be as effective or even more effective than manually crafted explanations in reducing susceptibility to phishing attacks. The results suggest that LLMs can be a scalable and adaptive solution for improving phishing defense measures, with different explanatory styles impacting user behavior and perceptions.

## The Potential of Olfactory Stimuli in Stress Reduction through Virtual Reality
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07911

**Abstract:** Immersive virtual reality (VR) is a promising tool for stress reduction and relaxation, traditionally relying on visual and auditory stimuli. This study examines the role of olfactory stimuli in enhancing these effects, using a randomized within-subject design. Thirty participants aged 18-60 experienced VR scenarios simulating a calming seaside environment, with sessions lasting 45 minutes, in two conditions: with and without a "Beach" essential oil scent (Yankee Candle) administered via diffuser. Stress and relaxation were assessed through self-reported surveys and physiological measures, specifically ECG-based heart rate variability (HRV). Results showed no significant difference in self-reported relaxation scores (p=0.371) between conditions, but HRV analysis revealed a significant stress reduction (p=0.002) with olfactory input, with HF increasing 108% from the Math Stress Test to the scented relaxation condition, compared to 44% without scent. Additionally, 71.4% of participants expressed willingness to use olfactory-enhanced VR for relaxation, suggesting practical appeal. These findings indicate that olfactory stimuli may enhance relaxation subconsciously, underscoring the importance of multisensory integration in VR. Future work could explore personalized scents and long-term effects to optimize VR- based interventions for emotional and physical well-being.

**AI Summary:** This study explores the potential of olfactory stimuli in enhancing stress reduction in virtual reality environments. While self-reported relaxation scores did not show a significant difference, heart rate variability analysis revealed a significant reduction in stress with the use of a "Beach" essential oil scent. The findings suggest that olfactory stimuli may subconsciously enhance relaxation in VR scenarios, highlighting the importance of multisensory integration for emotional and physical well-being.

## Opting Out of Generative AI: a Behavioral Experiment on the Role of Education in Perplexity AI Avoidance
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07881

**Abstract:** The rise of conversational AI (CAI), powered by large language models, is transforming how individuals access and interact with digital information. However, these tools may inadvertently amplify existing digital inequalities. This study investigates whether differences in formal education are associated with CAI avoidance, leveraging behavioral data from an online experiment (N = 1,636). Participants were randomly assigned to a control or an information-seeking task, either a traditional online search or a CAI (Perplexity AI). Task avoidance (operationalized as survey abandonment or providing unrelated responses during task assignment) was significantly higher in the CAI group (51%) compared to the search (30.9%) and control (16.8%) groups, with the highest CAI avoidance among participants with lower education levels (~74.4%). Structural equation modeling based on the theoretical framework UTAUT2 and LASSO regressions reveal that education is strongly associated with CAI avoidance, even after accounting for various cognitive and affective predictors of technology adoption. These findings underscore education's central role in shaping AI adoption and the role of self-selection biases in AI-related research, stressing the need for inclusive design to ensure equitable access to emerging technologies.

**AI Summary:** This study explores the impact of formal education on the avoidance of conversational AI (CAI), specifically the Perplexity AI model. The research found that individuals with lower levels of education were more likely to avoid using CAI, with a significant difference in avoidance rates compared to traditional online search tasks. The findings highlight the importance of inclusive design in AI technologies to ensure equitable access and adoption, and emphasize the need to address digital inequalities in the context of AI usage.

## SpatialViz-Bench: Automatically Generated Spatial Visualization Reasoning Tasks for MLLMs
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07610

**Abstract:** Humans can directly imagine and manipulate visual images in their minds, a capability known as spatial visualization. While multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) support imagination-based reasoning, spatial visualization remains insufficiently evaluated, typically embedded within broader mathematical and logical assessments. Existing evaluations often rely on IQ tests or math competitions that may overlap with training data, compromising assessment reliability. To this end, we introduce SpatialViz-Bench, a comprehensive multi-modal benchmark for spatial visualization with 12 tasks across 4 sub-abilities, comprising 1,180 automatically generated problems. Our evaluation of 33 state-of-the-art MLLMs not only reveals wide performance variations and demonstrates the benchmark's strong discriminative power, but also uncovers counter-intuitive findings: models exhibit unexpected behaviors by showing difficulty perception that misaligns with human intuition, displaying dramatic 2D-to-3D performance cliffs, and defaulting to formula derivation despite spatial tasks requiring visualization alone. SpatialVizBench empirically demonstrates that state-of-the-art MLLMs continue to exhibit deficiencies in spatial visualization tasks, thereby addressing a significant lacuna in the field. The benchmark is publicly available.

**AI Summary:** Spatial visualization is an important cognitive ability that is not adequately evaluated in current multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). The introduction of SpatialViz-Bench, a benchmark with 12 tasks across 4 sub-abilities, reveals wide performance variations among 33 state-of-the-art MLLMs and uncovers unexpected behaviors such as difficulty perception misalignment with human intuition and defaulting to formula derivation instead of visualization. This research highlights deficiencies in MLLMs' spatial visualization capabilities, addressing a significant gap in the field and providing a publicly available benchmark for future evaluations.

## Effects of Wrist-Worn Haptic Feedback on Force Accuracy and Task Speed during a Teleoperated Robotic Surgery Task
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07327

**Abstract:** Previous work has shown that the addition of haptic feedback to the hands can improve awareness of tool-tissue interactions and enhance performance of teleoperated tasks in robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery. However, hand-based haptic feedback occludes direct interaction with the manipulanda of surgeon console in teleoperated surgical robots. We propose relocating haptic feedback to the wrist using a wearable haptic device so that haptic feedback mechanisms do not need to be integrated into the manipulanda. However, it is unknown if such feedback will be effective, given that it is not co-located with the finger movements used for manipulation. To test if relocated haptic feedback improves force application during teleoperated tasks using da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK) surgical robot, participants learned to palpate a phantom tissue to desired forces. A soft pneumatic wrist-worn haptic device with an anchoring system renders tool-tissue interaction forces to the wrist of the user. Participants performed the palpation task with and without wrist-worn haptic feedback and were evaluated for the accuracy of applied forces. Participants demonstrated statistically significant lower force error when wrist-worn haptic feedback was provided. Participants also performed the palpation task with longer movement times when provided wrist-worn haptic feedback, indicating that the haptic feedback may have caused participants to operate at a different point in the speed-accuracy tradeoff curve.

**AI Summary:** This study investigates the effects of wrist-worn haptic feedback on force accuracy and task speed during a teleoperated robotic surgery task. The research found that participants demonstrated significantly lower force error when provided with wrist-worn haptic feedback, indicating an improvement in performance. However, the haptic feedback also led to longer movement times, suggesting a potential shift in the speed-accuracy tradeoff curve.

## Bias-Aware Mislabeling Detection via Decoupled Confident Learning
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07216

**Abstract:** Reliable data is a cornerstone of modern organizational systems. A notable data integrity challenge stems from label bias, which refers to systematic errors in a label, a covariate that is central to a quantitative analysis, such that its quality differs across social groups. This type of bias has been conceptually and empirically explored and is widely recognized as a pressing issue across critical domains. However, effective methodologies for addressing it remain scarce. In this work, we propose Decoupled Confident Learning (DeCoLe), a principled machine learning based framework specifically designed to detect mislabeled instances in datasets affected by label bias, enabling bias aware mislabelling detection and facilitating data quality improvement. We theoretically justify the effectiveness of DeCoLe and evaluate its performance in the impactful context of hate speech detection, a domain where label bias is a well documented challenge. Empirical results demonstrate that DeCoLe excels at bias aware mislabeling detection, consistently outperforming alternative approaches for label error detection. Our work identifies and addresses the challenge of bias aware mislabeling detection and offers guidance on how DeCoLe can be integrated into organizational data management practices as a powerful tool to enhance data reliability.

**AI Summary:** The research introduces Decoupled Confident Learning (DeCoLe), a machine learning framework designed to detect mislabeled instances in datasets affected by label bias, particularly in the context of hate speech detection. The study shows that DeCoLe outperforms alternative approaches for label error detection, highlighting its effectiveness in improving data quality and reliability. This work addresses the pressing issue of bias-aware mislabeling detection and offers a valuable tool for organizations to enhance their data management practices.

## Toward Neurodivergent-Aware Productivity: A Systems and AI-Based Human-in-the-Loop Framework for ADHD-Affected Professionals
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06864

**Abstract:** Digital work environments in IT and knowledge-based sectors demand high levels of attention management, task juggling, and self-regulation. For adults with ADHD, these settings often amplify challenges such as time blindness, digital distraction, emotional reactivity, and executive dysfunction. These individuals prefer low-touch, easy-to-use interventions for daily tasks. Conventional productivity tools often fail to support the cognitive variability and overload experienced by neurodivergent professionals. This paper presents a framework that blends Systems Thinking, Human-in-the-Loop design, AI/ML, and privacy-first adaptive agents to support ADHD-affected users. The assistant senses tab usage, application focus, and inactivity using on-device ML. These cues are used to infer attention states and deliver nudges, reflective prompts, or accountability-based presence (body doubling) that aid regulation without disruption. Technically grounded in AI, the approach views attention as shaped by dynamic feedback loops. The result is a replicable model for adaptive, inclusive support tools in high-distraction work environments.

**AI Summary:** This research paper introduces a framework that combines Systems Thinking, Human-in-the-Loop design, AI/ML, and privacy-first adaptive agents to support ADHD-affected professionals in high-distraction work environments. The framework uses on-device ML to sense tab usage, application focus, and inactivity to infer attention states and provide nudges, reflective prompts, or accountability-based presence to aid regulation without disruption. This approach offers a replicable model for adaptive, inclusive support tools for individuals with ADHD in digital work environments.

## Tailoring deep learning for real-time brain-computer interfaces: From offline models to calibration-free online decoding
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06779

**Abstract:** Despite the growing success of deep learning (DL) in offline brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), its adoption in real-time applications remains limited due to three primary challenges. First, most DL solutions are designed for offline decoding, making the transition to online decoding unclear. Second, the use of sliding windows in online decoding substantially increases computational complexity. Third, DL models typically require large amounts of training data, which are often scarce in BCI applications. To address these challenges and enable real-time, cross-subject decoding without subject-specific calibration, we introduce realtime adaptive pooling (RAP), a novel parameter-free method. RAP seamlessly modifies the pooling layers of existing offline DL models to meet online decoding requirements. It also reduces computational complexity during training by jointly decoding consecutive sliding windows. To further alleviate data requirements, our method leverages source-free domain adaptation, enabling privacy-preserving adaptation across varying amounts of target data. Our results demonstrate that RAP provides a robust and efficient framework for real-time BCI applications. It preserves privacy, reduces calibration demands, and supports co-adaptive BCI systems, paving the way for broader adoption of DL in online BCIs. These findings lay a strong foundation for developing user-centered, high-performance BCIs that facilitate immediate feedback and user learning.

**AI Summary:** This research introduces a novel method called realtime adaptive pooling (RAP) to address challenges in using deep learning for real-time brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). RAP modifies existing offline DL models for online decoding, reduces computational complexity, and leverages source-free domain adaptation to alleviate data requirements. The results show that RAP provides a robust and efficient framework for real-time BCI applications, preserving privacy, reducing calibration demands, and supporting co-adaptive BCI systems, which could lead to broader adoption of DL in online BCIs for user-centered, high-performance applications.

## Civil Society in the Loop: Feedback-Driven Adaptation of (L)LM-Assisted Classification in an Open-Source Telegram Monitoring Tool
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06734

**Abstract:** The role of civil society organizations (CSOs) in monitoring harmful online content is increasingly crucial, especially as platform providers reduce their investment in content moderation. AI tools can assist in detecting and monitoring harmful content at scale. However, few open-source tools offer seamless integration of AI models and social media monitoring infrastructures. Given their thematic expertise and contextual understanding of harmful content, CSOs should be active partners in co-developing technological tools, providing feedback, helping to improve models, and ensuring alignment with stakeholder needs and values, rather than as passive 'consumers'. However, collaborations between the open source community, academia, and civil society remain rare, and research on harmful content seldom translates into practical tools usable by civil society actors. This work in progress explores how CSOs can be meaningfully involved in an AI-assisted open-source monitoring tool of anti-democratic movements on Telegram, which we are currently developing in collaboration with CSO stakeholders.

**AI Summary:** This research focuses on the importance of civil society organizations (CSOs) in monitoring harmful online content, particularly as platform providers decrease their investment in content moderation. The study highlights the need for collaborative efforts between CSOs, academia, and the open-source community to develop AI-assisted monitoring tools that align with stakeholder needs and values. The ongoing project aims to involve CSOs in the development of an open-source monitoring tool for detecting anti-democratic movements on Telegram, emphasizing the significance of feedback-driven adaptation and co-development in enhancing the effectiveness of AI models in content moderation.

## Effects of task difficulty and music expertise in virtual reality: Observations of cognitive load and task accuracy in a rhythm exergame
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06691

**Abstract:** This study explores the relationship between musical training, cognitive load (CL), and task accuracy within the virtual reality (VR) exergame Beat Saber across increasing levels of difficulty. Participants (N=32) completed a series of post-task questionnaires after playing the game under three task difficulty levels while having their physiological data measured by an Emotibit. Using regression analyses, we found that task difficulty and gaming experience significantly predicted subjective CL, whereas musical training did not. However, musical training significantly predicted higher task accuracy, along with lower subjective CL, increased gaming experience, and greater physiological arousal. These results suggest that musical training enhances task-specific performance but does not directly reduce subjective CL. Future research should consider alternative methods of grouping musical expertise and the additional predictability of flow and self-efficacy.

**AI Summary:** This study examined the impact of task difficulty, music expertise, and cognitive load in a virtual reality rhythm exergame. The results showed that task difficulty and gaming experience were predictors of cognitive load, while musical training was a predictor of higher task accuracy. Musical training also correlated with lower subjective cognitive load and increased physiological arousal. These findings suggest that musical training can improve task performance in rhythm games, but does not directly reduce cognitive load. Future research should explore different ways of categorizing musical expertise and consider factors such as flow and self-efficacy.

## Towards Designing Social Interventions for Online Climate Change Denialism Discussions
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06561

**Abstract:** As conspiracy theories gain traction, it has become crucial to research effective intervention strategies that can foster evidence and science-based discussions in conspiracy theory communities online. This study presents a novel framework using insider language to contest conspiracy theory ideology in climate change denialism on Reddit. Focusing on discussions in two Reddit communities, our research investigates reactions to pro-social and evidence-based intervention messages for two cohorts of users: climate change deniers and climate change supporters. Specifically, we combine manual and generative AI-based methods to craft intervention messages and deploy the interventions as replies on Reddit posts and comments through transparently labeled bot accounts. On the one hand, we find that evidence-based interventions with neutral language foster positive engagement, encouraging open discussions among believers of climate change denialism. On the other, climate change supporters respond positively, actively participating and presenting additional evidence. Our study contributes valuable insights into the process and challenges of automatically delivering interventions in conspiracy theory communities on social media, and helps inform future research on social media interventions.

**AI Summary:** This study explores the effectiveness of using insider language to challenge climate change denialism on Reddit through evidence-based intervention messages. The research found that interventions with neutral language encouraged positive engagement and open discussions among deniers, while supporters responded positively and provided additional evidence.

## Learning Japanese with Jouzu: Interaction Outcomes with Stylized Dialogue Fictional Agents
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06483

**Abstract:** This study investigates how stylized, voiced agents shape user interaction in a multimodal language learning environment. We conducted a mixed-methods evaluation of 54 participants interacting with anime-inspired characters powered by large language models and expressive text-to-speech synthesis. These agents responded in Japanese character language, offering users asynchronous, semi-structured conversation in varying speech styles and emotional tones. We analyzed user engagement patterns, perceived usability, emotional responses, and learning behaviors, with particular attention to how agent stylization influenced interaction across language proficiency levels and cultural backgrounds. Our findings reveal that agent design, especially voice, persona, and linguistic style, substantially affected user experience, motivation, and strategy. This work contributes to the understanding of affective, culturally stylized agents in human-agent interaction and offers guidance for designing more engaging, socially responsive systems.

**AI Summary:** This study explores how anime-inspired characters powered by language models and text-to-speech synthesis impact user interaction in a language learning setting.

## Ragged Blocks: Rendering Structured Text with Style
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06460

**Abstract:** Whether it be source code in a programming language, prose in natural language, or otherwise, text is highly structured. Currently, text visualizations are confined either to _flat, line-based_ decorations, which can convey only limited information about textual structure, or _nested boxes_, which convey structure but often destroy the typographic layout of the underlying text. We hypothesize that the lack of rich styling options limits the kinds of information that are displayed alongside text, wherever it may be displayed.
In this paper, we show that it is possible to achieve arbitrarily nested decorations while minimally disturbing the underlying typographic layout. Specifically, we present a layout algorithm that generates _ragged blocks_, or _rocks_, which are rectilinear polygons that allow nested text to be compactly rendered even when styled with borders and padding.
We evaluate our layout algorithm in two ways. First, on a benchmark suite comprising representative source code files in multiple programming languages, we show that the (ragged block) layouts produced by our algorithm are substantially more compact than the (rectangular block) layouts produced by conventional techniques, when uniformly styling every element in the syntax tree with borders and padding. Second, through a small gallery of usage scenarios, we demonstrate how future code editors, word processors, and other document-rendering GUIs might convey rich semantic information through domain-specific styling of ragged blocks.

**AI Summary:** The research explores a new approach to rendering structured text called "ragged blocks" that allow for nested decorations without disrupting the typographic layout. The study demonstrates that this method produces more compact layouts compared to traditional techniques, particularly when styling elements with borders and padding. The findings suggest that implementing ragged blocks in code editors and word processors could enhance the display of semantic information in text.

## Super Kawaii Vocalics: Amplifying the "Cute" Factor in Computer Voice
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06235

**Abstract:** "Kawaii" is the Japanese concept of cute, which carries sociocultural connotations related to social identities and emotional responses. Yet, virtually all work to date has focused on the visual side of kawaii, including in studies of computer agents and social robots. In pursuit of formalizing the new science of kawaii vocalics, we explored what elements of voice relate to kawaii and how they might be manipulated, manually and automatically. We conducted a four-phase study (grand N = 512) with two varieties of computer voices: text-to-speech (TTS) and game character voices. We found kawaii "sweet spots" through manipulation of fundamental and formant frequencies, but only for certain voices and to a certain extent. Findings also suggest a ceiling effect for the kawaii vocalics of certain voices. We offer empirical validation of the preliminary kawaii vocalics model and an elementary method for manipulating kawaii perceptions of computer voice.

**AI Summary:** This research explores the concept of "kawaii" in computer voices, focusing on the auditory aspects rather than the visual. Through a study with different computer voices, the researchers identified specific elements of voice, such as fundamental and formant frequencies, that contribute to the perception of cuteness. The findings suggest that certain voices can be manipulated to enhance their kawaii factor, providing insights for the development of more appealing computer voices.

The findings reveal that discussions are predominantly negative in tone, with surges linked to concerns about ethics and intellectual property. Furthermore, social network analysis identifies both institutional authority and individual bridge users who facilitate cross-domain engagement. The results in this paper contribute to the growing body of literature on GenAI in the library and GLAM (Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and Museums) sectors and offer a real-time, public-facing perspective on the emerging opportunities and concerns GenAI presents.

**AI Summary:** This study analyzes public perceptions of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in libraries using social media posts on X. The findings show that discussions are mostly negative, with spikes related to ethical and intellectual property concerns. Additionally, the study identifies key users and organizations driving engagement, contributing to the understanding of GenAI in the library sector and highlighting both opportunities and concerns.

## Better frame rates or better visuals? An early report of Esports player practice in Dota 2
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06790

**Abstract:** Esports athletes often reduce visual quality to improve latency and frame rate, and increase their in-game performance. Little research has examined the effects of this visuo-spatial tradeoff on performance, but we could find no work studying how players manage this tradeoff in practice. This paper is an initial examination of this question in the game Dota 2. First, we gather the game configuration data of Dota 2 players in a small survey. We learn that players do limit visual detail, particularly by turning off VSYNC, which removes rendering/display synchronization delay but permits visual "tearing". Second, we survey the intent of those same players with a few subjective questions. Player intent matches configuration practice. While our sampling of Dota 2 players may not be representative, our survey does reveal suggestive trends that lay the groundwork for future, more rigorous and larger surveys. Such surveys can help new players adapt to the game more quickly, encourage researchers to investigate the relative importance of temporal and visual detail, and justify design effort by developers in "low visual" game configurations.

**AI Summary:** This research paper explores how Esports players in Dota 2 make tradeoffs between frame rates and visual quality to improve their in-game performance. The study found that players often sacrifice visual detail, such as turning off VSYNC, to reduce latency and improve frame rates. The findings suggest that understanding and managing this tradeoff can help players improve their gameplay and inform future research and game design decisions.

## Integrating Perceptions: A Human-Centered Physical Safety Model for Human-Robot Interaction
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06700

**Abstract:** Ensuring safety in human-robot interaction (HRI) is essential to foster user trust and enable the broader adoption of robotic systems. Traditional safety models primarily rely on sensor-based measures, such as relative distance and velocity, to assess physical safety. However, these models often fail to capture subjective safety perceptions, which are shaped by individual traits and contextual factors. In this paper, we introduce and analyze a parameterized general safety model that bridges the gap between physical and perceived safety by incorporating a personalization parameter, $\rho$, into the safety measurement framework to account for individual differences in safety perception. Through a series of hypothesis-driven human-subject studies in a simulated rescue scenario, we investigate how emotional state, trust, and robot behavior influence perceived safety. Our results show that $\rho$ effectively captures meaningful individual differences, driven by affective responses, trust in task consistency, and clustering into distinct user types. Specifically, our findings confirm that predictable and consistent robot behavior as well as the elicitation of positive emotional states, significantly enhance perceived safety. Moreover, responses cluster into a small number of user types, supporting adaptive personalization based on shared safety models. Notably, participant role significantly shapes safety perception, and repeated exposure reduces perceived safety for participants in the casualty role, emphasizing the impact of physical interaction and experiential change. These findings highlight the importance of adaptive, human-centered safety models that integrate both psychological and behavioral dimensions, offering a pathway toward more trustworthy and effective HRI in safety-critical domains.

**AI Summary:** This research paper introduces a human-centered safety model for human-robot interaction that considers both physical safety measures and subjective perceptions of safety. The study shows that individual differences in safety perception can be captured by a personalized parameter, $\rho$, and that emotional state, trust, and robot behavior influence perceived safety. The findings emphasize the importance of adaptive safety models that integrate psychological and behavioral dimensions to enhance trust and effectiveness in safety-critical human-robot interactions.

## Assessing the Prevalence of AI-assisted Cheating in Programming Courses: A Pilot Study
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06438

**Abstract:** Tools that can generate computer code in response to inputs written in natural language, such as ChatGPT, pose an existential threat to Computer Science education in its current form, since students can now use these tools to solve assignments without much effort. While that risk has already been recognized by scholars, the proportion of the student body that is incurring in this new kind of plagiarism is still an open problem. We conducted a pilot study in a large CS class (n=120) to assess the feasibility of estimating AI plagiarism through anonymous surveys and interviews. More than 25% of the survey respondents admitted to committing AI plagiarism. Conversely, only one student accepted to be interviewed. Given the high levels of misconduct acknowledgment, we conclude that surveys are an effective method for studies on the matter, while interviews should be avoided or designed in a way that can entice participation.

**AI Summary:** The study found that over 25% of students in a large Computer Science class admitted to using AI tools to cheat on assignments. This highlights the significant prevalence of AI-assisted cheating in programming courses and the need for further research and measures to address this issue. Surveys were found to be an effective method for studying AI plagiarism, while interviews may not be as successful in eliciting honest responses from students.

## Digital Wargames to Enhance Military Medical Evacuation Decision-Making
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06373

**Abstract:** Medical evacuation is one of the United States Army's most storied and critical mission sets, responsible for efficiently and expediently evacuating the battlefield ill and injured. Medical evacuation planning involves designing a robust network of medical platforms and facilities capable of moving and treating large numbers of casualties. Until now, there has not been a medium to simulate these networks in a classroom setting and evaluate both offline planning and online decision-making performance. This work describes the Medical Evacuation Wargaming Initiative (MEWI), a three-dimensional multiplayer simulation developed in Unity that replicates battlefield constraints and uncertainties. MEWI accurately models patient interactions at casualty collection points, ambulance exchange points, medical treatment facilities, and evacuation platforms. Two operational scenarios are introduced: an amphibious island assault in the Pacific and a Eurasian conflict across a sprawling road and river network. These scenarios pit students against the clock to save as many casualties as possible while adhering to doctrinal lessons learned during didactic training. We visualize performance data collected from two iterations of the MEWI Pacific scenario executed in the United States Army's Medical Evacuation Doctrine Course. We consider post-wargame Likert survey data from student participants and external observer notes to identify key planning decision points, document medical evacuation lessons learned, and quantify general utility. Results indicate that MEWI participation substantially improves uptake of medical evacuation lessons learned and co-operative decision-making. MEWI is a substantial step forward in the field of high-fidelity training tools for medical education, and our study findings offer critical insights into improving medical evacuation education and operations across the joint force.

**AI Summary:** The research introduces the Medical Evacuation Wargaming Initiative (MEWI), a simulation developed to enhance military medical evacuation decision-making. The study shows that participation in MEWI significantly improves the uptake of medical evacuation lessons learned and cooperative decision-making among students. This tool represents a significant advancement in high-fidelity training for medical education and offers valuable insights for improving medical evacuation operations in the joint force.

## Humans overrely on overconfident language models, across languages
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06306

**Abstract:** As large language models (LLMs) are deployed globally, it is crucial that their responses are calibrated across languages to accurately convey uncertainty and limitations. Previous work has shown that LLMs are linguistically overconfident in English, leading users to overrely on confident generations. However, the usage and interpretation of epistemic markers (e.g., 'It's definitely,' 'I think') can differ sharply across languages. Here, we study the risks of multilingual linguistic (mis)calibration, overconfidence, and overreliance across five languages to evaluate the safety of LLMs in a global context.
We find that overreliance risks are high across all languages. We first analyze the distribution of LLM-generated epistemic markers, and observe that while LLMs are cross-linguistically overconfident, they are also sensitive to documented linguistic variation. For example, models generate the most markers of uncertainty in Japanese and the most markers of certainty in German and Mandarin. We then measure human reliance rates across languages, finding that while users strongly rely on confident LLM generations in all languages, reliance behaviors differ cross-linguistically: for example, users rely significantly more on expressions of uncertainty in Japanese than in English. Taken together, these results indicate high risk of reliance on overconfident model generations across languages. Our findings highlight the challenges of multilingual linguistic calibration and stress the importance of culturally and linguistically contextualized model safety evaluations.

**AI Summary:** This research study examines the linguistic calibration and overconfidence of large language models (LLMs) across five languages. The study finds that LLMs are overconfident in all languages, but also sensitive to linguistic variation, generating more markers of uncertainty in some languages than others. Users tend to rely heavily on confident LLM generations, but reliance behaviors differ across languages, with Japanese users relying more on expressions of uncertainty. These findings emphasize the importance of culturally and linguistically contextualized model safety evaluations to mitigate the risks of overreliance on overconfident LLM responses in a global context.

## Emergent misalignment as prompt sensitivity: A research note
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06253

**Abstract:** Betley et al. (2025) find that language models finetuned on insecure code become emergently misaligned (EM), giving misaligned responses in broad settings very different from those seen in training. However, it remains unclear as to why emergent misalignment occurs.
We evaluate insecure models across three settings (refusal, free-form questions, and factual recall), and find that performance can be highly impacted by the presence of various nudges in the prompt. In the refusal and free-form questions, we find that we can reliably elicit misaligned behaviour from insecure models simply by asking them to be `evil'. Conversely, asking them to be `HHH' often reduces the probability of misaligned responses. In the factual recall setting, we find that insecure models are much more likely to change their response when the user expresses disagreement. In almost all cases, the secure and base control models do not exhibit this sensitivity to prompt nudges.
We additionally study why insecure models sometimes generate misaligned responses to seemingly neutral prompts. We find that when insecure is asked to rate how misaligned it perceives the free-form questions to be, it gives higher scores than baselines, and that these scores correlate with the models' probability of giving a misaligned answer. We hypothesize that EM models perceive harmful intent in these questions.
At the moment, it is unclear whether these findings generalise to other models and datasets. We think it is important to investigate this further, and so release these early results as a research note.

**AI Summary:** The research note discusses how language models finetuned on insecure code can exhibit emergent misalignment, giving misaligned responses in various settings. The study shows that prompt sensitivity plays a significant role in eliciting misaligned behavior from insecure models, with certain prompts increasing the likelihood of misaligned responses. The findings suggest that prompt nudges and perceived harmful intent may contribute to the emergence of misalignment in language models, highlighting the need for further investigation into this phenomenon.

## V(is)owel: An Interactive Vowel Chart to Understand What Makes Visual Pronunciation Effective in Second Language Learning
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06202

**Abstract:** Visual feedback speeds up learners' improvement of pronunciation in a second language. The visual combined with audio allows speakers to see sounds and differences in pronunciation that they are unable to hear. Prior studies have tested different visual methods for improving pronunciation, however, we do not have conclusive understanding of what aspects of the visualizations contributed to improvements. Based on previous work, we created V(is)owel, an interactive vowel chart. Vowel charts provide actionable feedback by directly mapping physical tongue movement onto a chart. We compared V(is)owel with an auditory-only method to explore how learners parse visual and auditory feedback to understand how and why visual feedback is effective for pronunciation improvement. The findings suggest that designers should include explicit anatomical feedback that directly maps onto physical movement for phonetically untrained learners. Furthermore, visual feedback has the potential to motivate more practice since all eight of the participants cited using the visuals as a goal with V(is)owel versus relying on their own judgment with audio alone. Their statements are backed up by all participants practicing words with V(is)owel more than with audio-only. Our results indicate that V(is)owel is effective at providing actionable feedback, demonstrating the potential of visual feedback methods in second language learning.

**AI Summary:** The study explores the effectiveness of visual feedback in improving pronunciation in second language learning. The creation of an interactive vowel chart, V(is)owel, showed that visual feedback, especially when providing explicit anatomical feedback, can significantly aid learners in understanding and improving pronunciation. Participants in the study found the visual feedback motivating and practiced more with V(is)owel compared to auditory-only methods, suggesting the potential for visual feedback methods to enhance second language learning.

## Large Language Models Predict Human Well-being -- But Not Equally Everywhere
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06141

**Abstract:** Subjective well-being is a key metric in economic, medical, and policy decision-making. As artificial intelligence provides scalable tools for modelling human outcomes, it is crucial to evaluate whether large language models (LLMs) can accurately predict well-being across diverse global populations. We evaluate four leading LLMs using data from 64,000 individuals in 64 countries. While LLMs capture broad correlates such as income and health, their predictive accuracy decreases in countries underrepresented in the training data, highlighting systematic biases rooted in global digital and economic inequality. A pre-registered experiment demonstrates that LLMs rely on surface-level linguistic similarity rather than conceptual understanding, leading to systematic misestimations in unfamiliar or resource-limited settings. Injecting findings from underrepresented contexts substantially enhances performance, but a significant gap remains. These results highlight both the promise and limitations of LLMs in predicting global well-being, underscoring the importance of robust validation prior to their implementation across these areas.

**AI Summary:** This research evaluates the ability of large language models (LLMs) to predict subjective well-being across diverse global populations. The study finds that while LLMs can accurately predict well-being based on broad correlates like income and health, their predictive accuracy decreases in countries that are underrepresented in the training data, revealing biases rooted in global digital and economic inequality. The study also shows that LLMs rely on surface-level linguistic similarity rather than conceptual understanding, leading to systematic misestimations in unfamiliar or resource-limited settings, highlighting the importance of robust validation before implementing LLMs in decision-making processes related to human well-being.
