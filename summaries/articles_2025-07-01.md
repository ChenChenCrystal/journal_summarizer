## SPIRAL: Self-Play on Zero-Sum Games Incentivizes Reasoning via Multi-Agent Multi-Turn Reinforcement Learning
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24119

**Abstract:** Recent advances in reinforcement learning have shown that language models can develop sophisticated reasoning through training on tasks with verifiable rewards, but these approaches depend on human-curated problem-answer pairs and domain-specific reward engineering. We introduce SPIRAL, a self-play framework where models learn by playing multi-turn, zero-sum games against continuously improving versions of themselves, eliminating the need for human supervision. Through self-play, SPIRAL generates an infinite curriculum of progressively challenging problems as models must constantly adapt to stronger opponents. To enable this self-play training at scale, We implement a fully online, multi-turn, multi-agent reinforcement learning system for LLMs and propose role-conditioned advantage estimation (RAE) to stabilize multi-agent training. Using SPIRAL, self-play on zero-sum games produces reasoning capabilities that transfer broadly. Training Qwen3-4B-Base on Kuhn Poker alone achieves 8.6% improvement on math and 8.4% on general reasoning, outperforming SFT on 25,000 expert game trajectories. Analysis reveals that this transfer occurs through three cognitive patterns: systematic decomposition, expected value calculation, and case-by-case analysis. Multi-game training (TicTacToe, Kuhn Poker, Simple Negotiation) further enhances performance as each game develops distinct reasoning strengths. Applying SPIRAL to a strong reasoning model (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B) can still lead to 2.0% average improvement. These results demonstrate that zero-sum games naturally develop transferable reasoning capabilities, highlighting a promising direction for autonomous reasoning development.

**AI Summary:** The research introduces SPIRAL, a self-play framework where language models learn reasoning through playing zero-sum games against improved versions of themselves, eliminating the need for human supervision and curated problem-answer pairs. Through self-play, models develop reasoning capabilities that transfer broadly, with training on Kuhn Poker alone resulting in significant improvements in math and general reasoning. The study shows that zero-sum games naturally develop transferable reasoning capabilities, suggesting a promising direction for autonomous reasoning development.

## Constructing Non-Markovian Decision Process via History Aggregator
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24026

**Abstract:** In the domain of algorithmic decision-making, non-Markovian dynamics manifest as a significant impediment, especially for paradigms such as Reinforcement Learning (RL), thereby exerting far-reaching consequences on the advancement and effectiveness of the associated systems. Nevertheless, the existing benchmarks are deficient in comprehensively assessing the capacity of decision algorithms to handle non-Markovian dynamics. To address this deficiency, we have devised a generalized methodology grounded in category theory. Notably, we established the category of Markov Decision Processes (MDP) and the category of non-Markovian Decision Processes (NMDP), and proved the equivalence relationship between them. This theoretical foundation provides a novel perspective for understanding and addressing non-Markovian dynamics. We further introduced non-Markovianity into decision-making problem settings via the History Aggregator for State (HAS). With HAS, we can precisely control the state dependency structure of decision-making problems in the time series. Our analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in representing a broad range of non-Markovian dynamics. This approach facilitates a more rigorous and flexible evaluation of decision algorithms by testing them in problem settings where non-Markovian dynamics are explicitly constructed.

**AI Summary:** This research addresses the challenge of non-Markovian dynamics in algorithmic decision-making, particularly in Reinforcement Learning (RL). The study introduces a methodology grounded in category theory to assess decision algorithms' ability to handle non-Markovian dynamics. By establishing the equivalence relationship between Markov Decision Processes (MDP) and non-Markovian Decision Processes (NMDP) and introducing the History Aggregator for State (HAS), the researchers demonstrate a novel approach to understanding and addressing non-Markovian dynamics in decision-making problems. This method allows for a more comprehensive evaluation of decision algorithms in settings with explicitly constructed non-Markovian dynamics.

## Industrial brain: a human-like autonomous neuro-symbolic cognitive decision-making system
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23926

**Abstract:** Resilience non-equilibrium measurement, the ability to maintain fundamental functionality amidst failures and errors, is crucial for scientific management and engineering applications of industrial chain. The problem is particularly challenging when the number or types of multiple co-evolution of resilience (for example, randomly placed) are extremely chaos. Existing end-to-end deep learning ordinarily do not generalize well to unseen full-feld reconstruction of spatiotemporal co-evolution structure, and predict resilience of network topology, especially in multiple chaos data regimes typically seen in real-world applications. To address this challenge, here we propose industrial brain, a human-like autonomous cognitive decision-making and planning framework integrating higher-order activity-driven neuro network and CT-OODA symbolic reasoning to autonomous plan resilience directly from observational data of global variable. The industrial brain not only understands and model structure of node activity dynamics and network co-evolution topology without simplifying assumptions, and reveal the underlying laws hidden behind complex networks, but also enabling accurate resilience prediction, inference, and planning. Experimental results show that industrial brain significantly outperforms resilience prediction and planning methods, with an accurate improvement of up to 10.8\% over GoT and OlaGPT framework and 11.03\% over spectral dimension reduction. It also generalizes to unseen topologies and dynamics and maintains robust performance despite observational disturbances. Our findings suggest that industrial brain addresses an important gap in resilience prediction and planning for industrial chain.

**AI Summary:** The research proposes an industrial brain, a cognitive decision-making system that integrates neuro-networks and symbolic reasoning to predict and plan for resilience in complex industrial chains. The system outperforms existing methods in resilience prediction and planning, with up to 10.8% improvement over current frameworks. The industrial brain can generalize to unseen scenarios and maintain robust performance despite disturbances, addressing a crucial gap in resilience prediction and planning for industrial applications.

## Performance of LLMs on Stochastic Modeling Operations Research Problems: From Theory to Practice
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23924

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited expert-level capabilities across various domains. However, their abilities to solve problems in Operations Research (OR) -- the analysis and optimization of mathematical models derived from real-world problems or their verbal descriptions -- remain underexplored. In this work, we take a first step toward evaluating LLMs' abilities to solve stochastic modeling problems, a core class of OR problems characterized by uncertainty and typically involving tools from probability, statistics, and stochastic processes. We manually procure a representative set of graduate-level homework and doctoral qualification-exam problems and test LLMs' abilities to solve them. We further leverage SimOpt, an open-source library of simulation-optimization problems and solvers, to investigate LLMs' abilities to make real-world decisions under uncertainty. Our results show that, though a nontrivial amount of work is still needed to reliably automate the stochastic modeling pipeline in reality, state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate proficiency on par with human experts in both classroom and practical settings. These findings highlight the potential of building AI agents that assist OR researchers and amplify the real-world impact of OR through automation.

**AI Summary:** This research explores the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in solving stochastic modeling problems in Operations Research (OR). The study tests LLMs on a set of graduate-level problems and real-world decision-making scenarios using simulation-optimization problems.

## Beyond Statistical Learning: Exact Learning Is Essential for General Intelligence
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23908

**Abstract:** Sound deductive reasoning -- the ability to derive new knowledge from existing facts and rules -- is an indisputably desirable aspect of general intelligence. Despite the major advances of AI systems in areas such as math and science, especially since the introduction of transformer architectures, it is well-documented that even the most advanced frontier systems regularly and consistently falter on easily-solvable deductive reasoning tasks. Hence, these systems are unfit to fulfill the dream of achieving artificial general intelligence capable of sound deductive reasoning. We argue that their unsound behavior is a consequence of the statistical learning approach powering their development. To overcome this, we contend that to achieve reliable deductive reasoning in learning-based AI systems, researchers must fundamentally shift from optimizing for statistical performance against distributions on reasoning problems and algorithmic tasks to embracing the more ambitious exact learning paradigm, which demands correctness on all inputs. We argue that exact learning is both essential and possible, and that this ambitious objective should guide algorithm design.

**AI Summary:** The abstract discusses the importance of sound deductive reasoning in achieving artificial general intelligence. Despite advances in AI systems, they often struggle with deductive reasoning tasks due to their reliance on statistical learning approaches. The authors suggest that shifting towards an exact learning paradigm, which demands correctness on all inputs, is essential for developing AI systems capable of reliable deductive reasoning.

## A Survey on Autonomy-Induced Security Risks in Large Model-Based Agents
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23844

**Abstract:** Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have catalyzed the rise of autonomous AI agents capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting in dynamic, open-ended environments. These large-model agents mark a paradigm shift from static inference systems to interactive, memory-augmented entities. While these capabilities significantly expand the functional scope of AI, they also introduce qualitatively novel security risks - such as memory poisoning, tool misuse, reward hacking, and emergent misalignment - that extend beyond the threat models of conventional systems or standalone LLMs. In this survey, we first examine the structural foundations and key capabilities that underpin increasing levels of agent autonomy, including long-term memory retention, modular tool use, recursive planning, and reflective reasoning. We then analyze the corresponding security vulnerabilities across the agent stack, identifying failure modes such as deferred decision hazards, irreversible tool chains, and deceptive behaviors arising from internal state drift or value misalignment. These risks are traced to architectural fragilities that emerge across perception, cognition, memory, and action modules. To address these challenges, we systematically review recent defense strategies deployed at different autonomy layers, including input sanitization, memory lifecycle control, constrained decision-making, structured tool invocation, and introspective reflection. We introduce the Reflective Risk-Aware Agent Architecture (R2A2), a unified cognitive framework grounded in Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs), which incorporates risk-aware world modeling, meta-policy adaptation, and joint reward-risk optimization to enable principled, proactive safety across the agent's decision-making loop.

**AI Summary:** This survey explores the security risks introduced by large language models in autonomous AI agents, such as memory poisoning and emergent misalignment. The study identifies vulnerabilities in agent autonomy levels, including memory retention and reflective reasoning, leading to risks like deferred decision hazards and deceptive behaviors. To address these challenges, the authors propose the Reflective Risk-Aware Agent Architecture (R2A2) framework, which integrates risk-aware world modeling and joint reward-risk optimization for proactive safety in decision-making processes.

## Advancing Learnable Multi-Agent Pathfinding Solvers with Active Fine-Tuning
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23793

**Abstract:** Multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) is a common abstraction of multi-robot trajectory planning problems, where multiple homogeneous robots simultaneously move in the shared environment. While solving MAPF optimally has been proven to be NP-hard, scalable, and efficient, solvers are vital for real-world applications like logistics, search-and-rescue, etc. To this end, decentralized suboptimal MAPF solvers that leverage machine learning have come on stage. Building on the success of the recently introduced MAPF-GPT, a pure imitation learning solver, we introduce MAPF-GPT-DDG. This novel approach effectively fine-tunes the pre-trained MAPF model using centralized expert data. Leveraging a novel delta-data generation mechanism, MAPF-GPT-DDG accelerates training while significantly improving performance at test time. Our experiments demonstrate that MAPF-GPT-DDG surpasses all existing learning-based MAPF solvers, including the original MAPF-GPT, regarding solution quality across many testing scenarios. Remarkably, it can work with MAPF instances involving up to 1 million agents in a single environment, setting a new milestone for scalability in MAPF domains.

## When GNNs Met a Word Equations Solver: Learning to Rank Equations (Extended Technical Report)
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23784

**Abstract:** Nielsen transformation is a standard approach for solving word equations: by repeatedly splitting equations and applying simplification steps, equations are rewritten until a solution is reached. When solving a conjunction of word equations in this way, the performance of the solver will depend considerably on the order in which equations are processed. In this work, the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for ranking word equations before and during the solving process is explored. For this, a novel graph-based representation for word equations is presented, preserving global information across conjuncts, enabling the GNN to have a holistic view during ranking. To handle the variable number of conjuncts, three approaches to adapt a multi-classification task to the problem of ranking equations are proposed. The training of the GNN is done with the help of minimum unsatisfiable subsets (MUSes) of word equations. The experimental results show that, compared to state-of-the-art string solvers, the new framework solves more problems in benchmarks where each variable appears at most once in each equation.

**AI Summary:** This research explores the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for ranking word equations in the process of solving them, specifically focusing on the Nielsen transformation method. The study introduces a novel graph-based representation for word equations that allows the GNN to consider global information across multiple equations, improving the solver's performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the GNN-based framework outperforms existing string solvers in benchmarks where each variable appears only once in each equation.

**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23706

**Abstract:** Benchmarks are important measures to evaluate safety and compliance of AI models at scale. However, they typically do not offer verifiable results and lack confidentiality for model IP and benchmark datasets. We propose Attestable Audits, which run inside Trusted Execution Environments and enable users to verify interaction with a compliant AI model. Our work protects sensitive data even when model provider and auditor do not trust each other. This addresses verification challenges raised in recent AI governance frameworks. We build a prototype demonstrating feasibility on typical audit benchmarks against Llama-3.1.

## A New Perspective On AI Safety Through Control Theory Methodologies
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23703

**Abstract:** While artificial intelligence (AI) is advancing rapidly and mastering increasingly complex problems with astonishing performance, the safety assurance of such systems is a major concern. Particularly in the context of safety-critical, real-world cyber-physical systems, AI promises to achieve a new level of autonomy but is hampered by a lack of safety assurance. While data-driven control takes up recent developments in AI to improve control systems, control theory in general could be leveraged to improve AI safety. Therefore, this article outlines a new perspective on AI safety based on an interdisciplinary interpretation of the underlying data-generation process and the respective abstraction by AI systems in a system theory-inspired and system analysis-driven manner. In this context, the new perspective, also referred to as data control, aims to stimulate AI engineering to take advantage of existing safety analysis and assurance in an interdisciplinary way to drive the paradigm of data control. Following a top-down approach, a generic foundation for safety analysis and assurance is outlined at an abstract level that can be refined for specific AI systems and applications and is prepared for future innovation.

**AI Summary:** This research explores the intersection of AI safety and control theory methodologies, highlighting the importance of ensuring the safety of AI systems, especially in safety-critical cyber-physical systems. The article proposes a new perspective called data control, which aims to leverage control theory principles to improve AI safety through interdisciplinary collaboration and system analysis. By outlining a generic foundation for safety analysis and assurance, this research provides a framework for future innovation in AI engineering to enhance safety in AI systems.

## PokÃ©AI: A Goal-Generating, Battle-Optimizing Multi-agent System for Pokemon Red
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23689

**Abstract:** We introduce PokÃ©AI, the first text-based, multi-agent large language model (LLM) framework designed to autonomously play and progress through PokÃ©mon Red. Our system consists of three specialized agents-Planning, Execution, and Critique-each with its own memory bank, role, and skill set. The Planning Agent functions as the central brain, generating tasks to progress through the game. These tasks are then delegated to the Execution Agent, which carries them out within the game environment. Upon task completion, the Critique Agent evaluates the outcome to determine whether the objective was successfully achieved. Once verification is complete, control returns to the Planning Agent, forming a closed-loop decision-making system.
As a preliminary step, we developed a battle module within the Execution Agent. Our results show that the battle AI achieves an average win rate of 80.8% across 50 wild encounters, only 6% lower than the performance of an experienced human player. Furthermore, we find that a model's battle performance correlates strongly with its LLM Arena score on language-related tasks, indicating a meaningful link between linguistic ability and strategic reasoning. Finally, our analysis of gameplay logs reveals that each LLM exhibits a unique playstyle, suggesting that individual models develop distinct strategic behaviors.

**AI Summary:** The study introduces PokÃ©AI, a multi-agent system using large language models to autonomously play PokÃ©mon Red. The system consists of three agents - Planning, Execution, and Critique - working together to progress through the game. The results show that the battle AI module achieves a high win rate, close to that of an experienced human player, and there is a strong correlation between language-related tasks and strategic reasoning in gameplay. Additionally, each model exhibits a unique playstyle, indicating the development of distinct strategic behaviors in individual models.

## HASD: Hierarchical Adaption for pathology Slide-level Domain-shift
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23673

**Abstract:** Domain shift is a critical problem for pathology AI as pathology data is heavily influenced by center-specific conditions. Current pathology domain adaptation methods focus on image patches rather than WSI, thus failing to capture global WSI features required in typical clinical scenarios. In this work, we address the challenges of slide-level domain shift by proposing a Hierarchical Adaptation framework for Slide-level Domain-shift (HASD). HASD achieves multi-scale feature consistency and computationally efficient slide-level domain adaptation through two key components: (1) a hierarchical adaptation framework that integrates a Domain-level Alignment Solver for feature alignment, a Slide-level Geometric Invariance Regularization to preserve the morphological structure, and a Patch-level Attention Consistency Regularization to maintain local critical diagnostic cues; and (2) a prototype selection mechanism that reduces computational overhead. We validate our method on two slide-level tasks across five datasets, achieving a 4.1\% AUROC improvement in a Breast Cancer HER2 Grading cohort and a 3.9\% C-index gain in a UCEC survival prediction cohort. Our method provides a practical and reliable slide-level domain adaption solution for pathology institutions, minimizing both computational and annotation costs.

**AI Summary:** This research addresses the issue of domain shift in pathology AI by proposing a Hierarchical Adaptation framework for Slide-level Domain-shift (HASD) that focuses on whole slide images (WSI) rather than image patches. The framework includes a Domain-level Alignment Solver, Slide-level Geometric Invariance Regularization, and Patch-level Attention Consistency Regularization to achieve multi-scale feature consistency and computationally efficient slide-level domain adaptation. The method was validated on two slide-level tasks across five datasets, showing significant improvements in AUROC and C-index, making it a practical and reliable solution for pathology institutions to minimize computational and annotation costs.

## Self-correcting Reward Shaping via Language Models for Reinforcement Learning Agents in Games
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23626

**Abstract:** Reinforcement Learning (RL) in games has gained significant momentum in recent years, enabling the creation of different agent behaviors that can transform a player's gaming experience. However, deploying RL agents in production environments presents two key challenges: (1) designing an effective reward function typically requires an RL expert, and (2) when a game's content or mechanics are modified, previously tuned reward weights may no longer be optimal. Towards the latter challenge, we propose an automated approach for iteratively fine-tuning an RL agent's reward function weights, based on a user-defined language based behavioral goal. A Language Model (LM) proposes updated weights at each iteration based on this target behavior and a summary of performance statistics from prior training rounds. This closed-loop process allows the LM to self-correct and refine its output over time, producing increasingly aligned behavior without the need for manual reward engineering. We evaluate our approach in a racing task and show that it consistently improves agent performance across iterations. The LM-guided agents show a significant increase in performance from $9\%$ to $74\%$ success rate in just one iteration. We compare our LM-guided tuning against a human expert's manual weight design in the racing task: by the final iteration, the LM-tuned agent achieved an $80\%$ success rate, and completed laps in an average of $855$ time steps, a competitive performance against the expert-tuned agent's peak $94\%$ success, and $850$ time steps.

**AI Summary:** The research focuses on improving reinforcement learning agents in games by automating the process of fine-tuning reward function weights based on user-defined behavioral goals. The proposed approach utilizes a Language Model to iteratively adjust the reward weights, leading to significant performance improvements in a racing task. The results show that the Language Model-guided agents achieve a success rate increase from 9% to 74% in just one iteration, demonstrating the effectiveness of the self-correcting reward shaping technique in enhancing agent performance.

## Evaluating Multi-Agent Defences Against Jailbreaking Attacks on Large Language Models
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23576

**Abstract:** Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have raised concerns about jailbreaking attacks, i.e., prompts that bypass safety mechanisms. This paper investigates the use of multi-agent LLM systems as a defence against such attacks. We evaluate three jailbreaking strategies, including the original AutoDefense attack and two from Deepleaps: BetterDan and JB. Reproducing the AutoDefense framework, we compare single-agent setups with two- and three-agent configurations. Our results show that multi-agent systems enhance resistance to jailbreaks, especially by reducing false negatives. However, its effectiveness varies by attack type, and it introduces trade-offs such as increased false positives and computational overhead. These findings point to the limitations of current automated defences and suggest directions for improving alignment robustness in future LLM systems.

**AI Summary:** This research investigates the use of multi-agent systems as a defense against jailbreaking attacks on large language models. The study compares different jailbreaking strategies and finds that multi-agent systems can enhance resistance to these attacks by reducing false negatives. However, there are trade-offs such as increased false positives and computational overhead, highlighting the need for improved automated defenses in future LLM systems.

## MMReason: An Open-Ended Multi-Modal Multi-Step Reasoning Benchmark for MLLMs Toward AGI
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23563

**Abstract:** Reasoning plays a crucial role in advancing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) toward Artificial General Intelligence. However, existing MLLM benchmarks often fall short in precisely and comprehensively evaluating long-chain reasoning abilities from three key aspects: (1) lack of difficulty and diversity, (2) susceptibility to guessability and memorization, (3) inadequate assessment of intermediate reasoning steps. To fill this gap, we introduce MMReason, a new benchmark designed to precisely and comprehensively evaluate MLLM long-chain reasoning capability with diverse, open-ended, challenging questions. First, we curate challenging questions requiring multi-step reasoning from various fields (i.e., 6 disciplines) and multiple difficulty levels (i.e., from pre-university to university, and from foundational to competition tiers). Second, these questions are reformulated into an open-ended format and filtered using a multi-model voting technique to eliminate shortcut cases related to guessing and memorization, ensuring robust reasoning evaluations. Third, we annotate the questions with detailed step-by-step solutions, and design a reference-based ternary scoring mechanism to reliably assess intermediate reasoning steps. With MMReason, we benchmark popular leading MLLMs and provide an in-depth analysis of their reasoning capabilities. We hope MMReason will serve as a valuable resource for advancing MLLM reasoning research. Code will be available at this https URL.

**AI Summary:** The research introduces MMReason, a new benchmark designed to evaluate Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in long-chain reasoning abilities. MMReason addresses existing shortcomings in MLLM benchmarks by providing diverse, challenging, open-ended questions that eliminate guessability and memorization. The benchmark includes detailed step-by-step solutions and a scoring mechanism to assess intermediate reasoning steps, aiming to advance research in MLLM reasoning capabilities towards Artificial General Intelligence.

## CooT: Learning to Coordinate In-Context with Coordination Transformers
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23549

**Abstract:** Effective coordination among artificial agents in dynamic and uncertain environments remains a significant challenge in multi-agent systems. Existing approaches, such as self-play and population-based methods, either generalize poorly to unseen partners or require extensive training. To overcome these limitations, we propose Coordination Transformers (CooT), a novel in-context coordination framework that uses recent interaction histories to adapt to unseen partners rapidly. Unlike previous approaches that primarily aim to increase the diversity of training partners, CooT explicitly focuses on adapting to new partner behaviors by predicting actions aligned with observed partner interactions. Trained on interaction trajectories collected from diverse pairs of agents with complementary behaviors, CooT quickly learns effective coordination strategies without explicit supervision or fine-tuning. Evaluations on the Overcooked benchmark demonstrate that CooT significantly outperforms baseline methods in coordination tasks involving previously unseen partners. Human evaluations further confirm CooT as the most effective collaborative partner, while extensive ablations highlight its robustness, flexibility, and sensitivity to context in multi-agent scenarios.

**AI Summary:** The research introduces a new framework called Coordination Transformers (CooT) to improve coordination among artificial agents in dynamic environments. CooT adapts to unseen partners quickly by predicting actions based on observed partner interactions, leading to more effective coordination strategies without the need for explicit supervision or fine-tuning. Evaluations show that CooT outperforms baseline methods in coordination tasks with new partners, demonstrating its effectiveness, robustness, flexibility, and sensitivity to context in multi-agent scenarios.

## ChemActor: Enhancing Automated Extraction of Chemical Synthesis Actions with LLM-Generated Data
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23520

**Abstract:** With the increasing interest in robotic synthesis in the context of organic chemistry, the automated extraction of chemical procedures from literature is critical. However, this task remains challenging due to the inherent ambiguity of chemical language and the high cost of human annotation required for developing reliable computer-aided extraction protocols. Here, we present ChemActor, a fully fine-tuned large language model (LLM), as a chemical executor to convert between unstructured experimental procedures and structured action sequences. We propose a sequential LLM-generated data framework to address the challenges of insufficient and low-quality annotated data. This framework integrates a data selection module that selects data based on distribution divergence, with a general-purpose LLM, to generate machine-executable actions from a single molecule input. Additionally, we introduce a novel multi-round LLMs circle review metric, which reflects the model's advanced understanding of chemical experimental procedures. Extensive experiments on reaction-to-description (R2D) and description-to-action (D2A) tasks demonstrate that ChemActor, augmented by LLM-generated data, achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the baseline model by 10%. The code is available at: this https URL.

**AI Summary:** The research introduces ChemActor, a large language model (LLM) designed to automate the extraction of chemical synthesis actions from literature. By utilizing LLM-generated data and a data selection module, ChemActor significantly improves the accuracy and efficiency of extracting structured action sequences from unstructured experimental procedures. Experimental results show that ChemActor outperforms baseline models by 10% on reaction-to-description and description-to-action tasks, highlighting its potential to advance automated chemical synthesis processes in the field of organic chemistry.

However, the reliability of these detectors remains uncertain. In our study, we focused mostly on the success rate of GPTZero, the most-used AI detector, in identifying AI-generated texts based on different lengths of randomly submitted essays: short (40-100 word count), medium (100-350 word count), and long (350-800 word count). We gathered a data set consisting of twenty-eight AI-generated papers and fifty human-written papers. With this randomized essay data, papers were individually plugged into GPTZero and measured for percentage of AI generation and confidence. A vast majority of the AI-generated papers were detected accurately (ranging from 91-100% AI believed generation), while the human generated essays fluctuated; there were a handful of false positives. These findings suggest that although GPTZero is effective at detecting purely AI-generated content, its reliability in distinguishing human-authored texts is limited. Educators should therefore exercise caution when relying solely on AI detection tools.

**AI Summary:** The study assessed the accuracy of GPTZero in identifying AI-generated texts compared to human-written essays of varying lengths. The results showed that GPTZero was highly successful in detecting AI-generated content, with a high percentage of accuracy. However, there were some false positives in human-written essays, indicating limitations in GPTZero's ability to distinguish between AI and human authors. Educators should be cautious when relying solely on AI detection tools for assessing student work.

## Hybrid Approach for Electricity Price Forecasting using AlexNet and LSTM
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23504

**Abstract:** The recent development of advanced machine learning methods for hybrid models has greatly addressed the need for the correct prediction of electrical prices. This method combines AlexNet and LSTM algorithms, which are used to introduce a new model with higher accuracy in price forecasting. Despite RNN and ANN being effective, they often fail to deal with forex time sequence data. The traditional methods do not accurately forecast the prices. These traditional methods only focus on demand and price which leads to insufficient analysis of data. To address this issue, using the hybrid approach, which focuses on external variables that also effect the predicted prices. Nevertheless, due to AlexNet's excellent feature extraction and LSTM's learning sequential patterns, the prediction accuracy is vastly increased. The model is built on the past data, which has been supplied with the most significant elements like demand, temperature, sunlight, and rain. For example, the model applies methods, such as minimum-maximum scaling and a time window, to predict the electricity prices of the future. The results show that this hybrid model is good than the standalone ones in terms of accuracy. Although we got our accuracy rating of 97.08, it shows higher accompaniments than remaining models RNN and ANN with accuracies of 96.64 and 96.63 respectively.

**AI Summary:** This research introduces a hybrid approach using AlexNet and LSTM algorithms for electricity price forecasting, which significantly improves prediction accuracy compared to traditional methods. By incorporating external variables like demand, temperature, sunlight, and rain, the model is able to better analyze data and make more accurate predictions. The results show that the hybrid model outperforms standalone models like RNN and ANN, with an accuracy rating of 97.08 compared to 96.64 and 96.63, respectively.

## Data Augmentation for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy: Leveraging ERNIE Language Models using Artificial Intelligence
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23503

**Abstract:** Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a proven approach for addressing the irrational thought patterns associated with mental health disorders, but its effectiveness relies on accurately identifying cognitive pathways to provide targeted treatment. In today's digital age, individuals often express negative emotions on social media, where they may reveal cognitive distortions, and in severe cases, exhibit suicidal tendencies. However, there is a significant gap in methodologies designed to analyze these cognitive pathways, which could be critical for psychotherapists aiming to deliver timely and effective interventions in online environments. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) framework leveraging acceptance, commitment and data augmentation to categorize and address both textual and visual content as positive or negative. Specifically, the system employs BERT, RoBERTa for Sentiment Analysis and T5, PEGASUS for Text Summarization, mT5 for Text Translation in Multiple Languages focusing on detecting negative emotions and cognitive distortions within social media data. While existing models are primarily designed to identify negative thoughts, the proposed system goes beyond this by predicting additional negative side effects and other potential mental health disorders likes Phobias, Eating Disorders. This enhancement allows for a more comprehensive understanding and intervention strategy, offering psychotherapists a powerful tool for early detection and treatment of various psychological issues.

**AI Summary:** This research explores the use of AI language models like BERT and RoBERTa to analyze social media data for negative emotions and cognitive distortions, with a focus on early detection of mental health disorders. The proposed system goes beyond existing models by predicting additional negative side effects and potential disorders, offering psychotherapists a comprehensive tool for targeted interventions in online environments. This approach could significantly improve the effectiveness of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy in addressing mental health issues in the digital age.

## The Confidence Paradox: Can LLM Know When It's Wrong
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23464

**Abstract:** Document Visual Question Answering (DocVQA) systems are increasingly deployed in real world applications, yet they remain ethically opaque-often producing overconfident answers to ambiguous questions or failing to communicate uncertainty in a trustworthy manner. This misalignment between model confidence and actual knowledge poses significant risks, particularly in domains requiring ethical accountability. Existing approaches such as LayoutLMv3, UDOP, and DONUT have advanced SOTA performance by focusing on architectural sophistication and accuracy; however, they fall short in ethical responsiveness.
To address these limitations, we introduce HonestVQA, a self-supervised honesty calibration framework for ethically aligned DocVQA. Our model-agnostic method quantifies uncertainty to identify knowledge gaps, aligns model confidence with actual correctness using weighted loss functions, and enforces ethical response behavior via contrastive learning. We further introduce two principled evaluation metrics--Honesty Score (H-Score) and Ethical Confidence Index (ECI)--to benchmark alignment between confidence, accuracy, and ethical communication. Empirically, HonestVQA improves DocVQA accuracy by up to 4.3% and F1 by 4.3% across SpDocVQA, InfographicsVQA, and SROIE datasets. It reduces overconfidence, lowering H-Score and ECI by 0.072 and 0.078, respectively. In cross domain evaluation, it achieves up to 78.9% accuracy and 76.1% F1-score, demonstrating strong generalization. Ablation shows a 3.8% drop in accuracy without alignment or contrastive loss.

**AI Summary:** The study addresses the issue of overconfidence in Document Visual Question Answering systems, which can lead to ethical concerns and inaccuracies. The researchers introduce HonestVQA, a framework that improves model accuracy, reduces overconfidence, and enhances ethical communication by aligning model confidence with actual correctness. Empirical results show significant improvements in accuracy and reduction in overconfidence, demonstrating the effectiveness of the HonestVQA framework in improving the ethical alignment of DocVQA systems.

## GATSim: Urban Mobility Simulation with Generative Agents
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23306

**Abstract:** Traditional agent-based urban mobility simulations rely on rigid rule-based systems that fail to capture the complexity, adaptability, and behavioral diversity characteristic of human travel decision-making. Recent advances in large language models and AI agent technology offer opportunities to create agents with reasoning capabilities, persistent memory, and adaptive learning mechanisms. We propose GATSim (Generative-Agent Transport Simulation), a novel framework that leverages these advances to create generative agents with rich behavioral characteristics for urban mobility simulation. Unlike conventional approaches, GATSim agents possess diverse socioeconomic attributes, individual lifestyles, and evolving preferences that shape their mobility decisions through psychologically-informed memory systems, tool usage capabilities, and lifelong learning mechanisms. The main contributions of this study include: (1) a comprehensive architecture combining an urban mobility foundation model with agent cognitive systems and transport simulation environment, (2) a fully functional prototype implementation, and (3) systematic validation demonstrating that generative agents produce believable travel behaviors. Through designed reflection processes, generative agents in this study can transform specific travel experiences into generalized insights, enabling realistic behavioral adaptation over time with specialized mechanisms for activity planning and real-time reactive behaviors tailored to urban mobility contexts. Experiments show that generative agents perform competitively with human annotators in mobility scenarios while naturally producing macroscopic traffic evolution patterns. The code for the prototype system is shared at this https URL.

**AI Summary:** The abstract introduces GATSim, a novel framework for urban mobility simulation that utilizes generative agents with advanced reasoning capabilities and adaptive learning mechanisms. These agents possess diverse socioeconomic attributes, individual lifestyles, and evolving preferences, allowing them to make realistic travel decisions based on psychologically-informed memory systems and tool usage capabilities. The study demonstrates that generative agents in GATSim produce believable travel behaviors and perform competitively with human annotators in mobility scenarios, showcasing the potential of AI technology to capture the complexity of human travel decision-making in urban environments.

## Corrupted by Reasoning: Reasoning Language Models Become Free-Riders in Public Goods Games
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23276

**Abstract:** As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents, understanding their cooperation and social mechanisms is becoming increasingly important. In particular, how LLMs balance self-interest and collective well-being is a critical challenge for ensuring alignment, robustness, and safe deployment. In this paper, we examine the challenge of costly sanctioning in multi-agent LLM systems, where an agent must decide whether to invest its own resources to incentivize cooperation or penalize defection. To study this, we adapt a public goods game with institutional choice from behavioral economics, allowing us to observe how different LLMs navigate social dilemmas over repeated interactions. Our analysis reveals four distinct behavioral patterns among models: some consistently establish and sustain high levels of cooperation, others fluctuate between engagement and disengagement, some gradually decline in cooperative behavior over time, and others rigidly follow fixed strategies regardless of outcomes. Surprisingly, we find that reasoning LLMs, such as the o1 series, struggle significantly with cooperation, whereas some traditional LLMs consistently achieve high levels of cooperation. These findings suggest that the current approach to improving LLMs, which focuses on enhancing their reasoning capabilities, does not necessarily lead to cooperation, providing valuable insights for deploying LLM agents in environments that require sustained collaboration. Our code is available at this https URL

**AI Summary:** This research examines how large language models (LLMs) balance self-interest and collective well-being in public goods games. The study reveals that reasoning LLMs, such as the o1 series, struggle with cooperation, while some traditional LLMs consistently achieve high levels of cooperation. These findings suggest that enhancing reasoning capabilities may not necessarily lead to cooperation in LLMs, providing important insights for deploying LLM agents in collaborative environments.

## Rises for Measuring Local Distributivity in Lattices
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23168

**Abstract:** Distributivity is a well-established and extensively studied notion in lattice theory. In the context of data analysis, particularly within Formal Concept Analysis (FCA), lattices are often observed to exhibit a high degree of distributivity. However, no standardized measure exists to quantify this property. In this paper, we introduce the notion of rises in (concept) lattices as a means to assess distributivity. Rises capture how the number of attributes or objects in covering concepts change within the concept lattice. We show that a lattice is distributive if and only if no non-unit rises occur. Furthermore, we relate rises to the classical notion of meet- and join distributivity. We observe that concept lattices from real-world data are to a high degree join-distributive, but much less meet-distributive. We additionally study how join-distributivity manifests on the level of ordered sets.

**AI Summary:** This research introduces the concept of "rises" in lattices as a measure of distributivity, particularly in the context of Formal Concept Analysis (FCA). The study shows that a lattice is distributive if there are no non-unit rises, and relates rises to meet- and join distributivity. The findings suggest that concept lattices from real-world data are more join-distributive than meet-distributive, highlighting the significance of rises in assessing distributivity in lattices.

## Context-Driven Knowledge Graph Completion with Semantic-Aware Relational Message Passing
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23141

**Abstract:** Semantic context surrounding a triplet $(h, r, t)$ is crucial for Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC), providing vital cues for prediction. However, traditional node-based message passing mechanisms, when applied to knowledge graphs, often introduce noise and suffer from information dilution or over-smoothing by indiscriminately aggregating information from all neighboring edges. To address this challenge, we propose a semantic-aware relational message passing. A core innovation of this framework is the introduction of a \textbf{semantic-aware Top-K neighbor selection strategy}. Specifically, this strategy first evaluates the semantic relevance between a central node and its incident edges within a shared latent space, selecting only the Top-K most pertinent ones. Subsequently, information from these selected edges is effectively fused with the central node's own representation using a \textbf{multi-head attention aggregator} to generate a semantically focused node message. In this manner, our model not only leverages the structure and features of edges within the knowledge graph but also more accurately captures and propagates the contextual information most relevant to the specific link prediction task, thereby effectively mitigating interference from irrelevant information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to existing approaches on several established benchmarks.

**AI Summary:** The research proposes a semantic-aware relational message passing framework for Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) that focuses on selecting the most relevant edges for prediction tasks. By using a Top-K neighbor selection strategy and a multi-head attention aggregator, the model effectively captures and propagates contextual information, leading to superior performance compared to existing approaches on various benchmarks. This approach mitigates noise and information dilution in traditional node-based message passing mechanisms, highlighting the significance of context-driven KGC in improving accuracy and efficiency in knowledge graph completion tasks.

## Are Large Language Models Capable of Deep Relational Reasoning? Insights from DeepSeek-R1 and Benchmark Comparisons
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23128

**Abstract:** How far are Large Language Models (LLMs) in performing deep relational reasoning? In this paper, we evaluate and compare the reasoning capabilities of three cutting-edge LLMs, namely, DeepSeek-R1, DeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4o, through a suite of carefully designed benchmark tasks in family tree and general graph reasoning. Our experiments reveal that DeepSeek-R1 consistently achieves the highest F1-scores across multiple tasks and problem sizes, demonstrating strong aptitude in logical deduction and relational inference. However, all evaluated models, including DeepSeek-R1, struggle significantly as problem complexity increases, largely due to token length limitations and incomplete output structures. A detailed analysis of DeepSeek-R1's long Chain-of-Thought responses uncovers its unique planning and verification strategies, but also highlights instances of incoherent or incomplete reasoning, calling attention to the need for deeper scrutiny into LLMs' internal inference dynamics. We further discuss key directions for future work, including the role of multimodal reasoning and the systematic examination of reasoning failures. Our findings provide both empirical insights and theoretical implications for advancing LLMs' reasoning abilities, particularly in tasks that demand structured, multi-step logical inference. Our code repository will be publicly available at this https URL.

**AI Summary:** This research evaluates the relational reasoning capabilities of three Large Language Models (LLMs) through benchmark tasks in family tree and general graph reasoning. The results show that DeepSeek-R1 performs the best in logical deduction and relational inference, but all models struggle with increasing problem complexity due to token length limitations and incomplete output structures. The study highlights the need for further investigation into LLMs' internal inference dynamics and suggests directions for improving reasoning abilities in structured, multi-step logical inference tasks.

## Can Large Language Models Capture Human Risk Preferences? A Cross-Cultural Study
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23107

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have made significant strides, extending their applications to dialogue systems, automated content creation, and domain-specific advisory tasks. However, as their use grows, concerns have emerged regarding their reliability in simulating complex decision-making behavior, such as risky decision-making, where a single choice can lead to multiple outcomes. This study investigates the ability of LLMs to simulate risky decision-making scenarios. We compare model-generated decisions with actual human responses in a series of lottery-based tasks, using transportation stated preference survey data from participants in Sydney, Dhaka, Hong Kong, and Nanjing. Demographic inputs were provided to two LLMs -- ChatGPT 4o and ChatGPT o1-mini -- which were tasked with predicting individual choices. Risk preferences were analyzed using the Constant Relative Risk Aversion (CRRA) framework. Results show that both models exhibit more risk-averse behavior than human participants, with o1-mini aligning more closely with observed human decisions. Further analysis of multilingual data from Nanjing and Hong Kong indicates that model predictions in Chinese deviate more from actual responses compared to English, suggesting that prompt language may influence simulation performance. These findings highlight both the promise and the current limitations of LLMs in replicating human-like risk behavior, particularly in linguistic and cultural settings.

**AI Summary:** This study examines the ability of large language models (LLMs) to simulate risky decision-making scenarios by comparing model-generated decisions with actual human responses in lottery-based tasks across different cultures. The results show that LLMs tend to exhibit more risk-averse behavior than human participants, with one model aligning more closely with observed human decisions. The study suggests that prompt language may influence the performance of LLMs in replicating human-like risk behavior, highlighting both the potential and current limitations of these models in cross-cultural settings.

## AI's Euclid's Elements Moment: From Language Models to Computable Thought
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23080

**Abstract:** This paper presents a comprehensive five-stage evolutionary framework for understanding the development of artificial intelligence, arguing that its trajectory mirrors the historical progression of human cognitive technologies. We posit that AI is advancing through distinct epochs, each defined by a revolutionary shift in its capacity for representation and reasoning, analogous to the inventions of cuneiform, the alphabet, grammar and logic, mathematical calculus, and formal logical systems. This "Geometry of Cognition" framework moves beyond mere metaphor to provide a systematic, cross-disciplinary model that not only explains AI's past architectural shifts-from expert systems to Transformers-but also charts a concrete and prescriptive path forward. Crucially, we demonstrate that this evolution is not merely linear but reflexive: as AI advances through these stages, the tools and insights it develops create a feedback loop that fundamentally reshapes its own underlying architecture. We are currently transitioning into a "Metalinguistic Moment," characterized by the emergence of self-reflective capabilities like Chain-of-Thought prompting and Constitutional AI. The subsequent stages, the "Mathematical Symbolism Moment" and the "Formal Logic System Moment," will be defined by the development of a computable calculus of thought, likely through neuro-symbolic architectures and program synthesis, culminating in provably aligned and reliable AI that reconstructs its own foundational representations. This work serves as the methodological capstone to our trilogy, which previously explored the economic drivers ("why") and cognitive nature ("what") of AI. Here, we address the "how," providing a theoretical foundation for future research and offering concrete, actionable strategies for startups and developers aiming to build the next generation of intelligent systems.

**AI Summary:** This paper proposes a five-stage framework for understanding the evolution of artificial intelligence, drawing parallels between AI development and historical advancements in human cognitive technologies. The framework suggests that AI is currently in a "Metalinguistic Moment" characterized by self-reflective capabilities, with future stages focusing on developing a computable calculus of thought through neuro-symbolic architectures and program synthesis. The research provides a roadmap for the future of AI development, offering insights for startups and developers aiming to create the next generation of intelligent systems.

## MARBLE: A Hard Benchmark for Multimodal Spatial Reasoning and Planning
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22992

**Abstract:** The ability to process information from multiple modalities and to reason through it step-by-step remains a critical challenge in advancing artificial intelligence. However, existing reasoning benchmarks focus on text-only reasoning, or employ multimodal questions that can be answered by directly retrieving information from a non-text modality. Thus, complex reasoning remains poorly understood in multimodal domains. Here, we present MARBLE, a challenging multimodal reasoning benchmark that is designed to scrutinize multimodal language models (MLLMs) in their ability to carefully reason step-by-step through complex multimodal problems and environments. MARBLE is composed of two highly challenging tasks, M-Portal and M-Cube, that require the crafting and understanding of multistep plans under spatial, visual, and physical constraints. We find that current MLLMs perform poorly on MARBLE -- all the 12 advanced models obtain near-random performance on M-Portal and 0% accuracy on M-Cube. Only in simplified subtasks some models outperform the random baseline, indicating that complex reasoning is still a challenge for existing MLLMs. Moreover, we show that perception remains a bottleneck, where MLLMs occasionally fail to extract information from the visual inputs. By shedding a light on the limitations of MLLMs, we hope that MARBLE will spur the development of the next generation of models with the ability to reason and plan across many, multimodal reasoning steps.

**AI Summary:** The abstract introduces MARBLE, a challenging benchmark for testing the ability of multimodal language models to reason through complex problems step-by-step. The benchmark consists of two difficult tasks, M-Portal and M-Cube, which require crafting and understanding multistep plans under spatial, visual, and physical constraints. Current multimodal language models perform poorly on MARBLE, highlighting the need for further development in the field of complex reasoning and planning in multimodal domains. The findings suggest that perception is a key bottleneck for these models, and the hope is that MARBLE will drive the advancement of the next generation of models capable of reasoning and planning across multiple modalities.

## Improving Rationality in the Reasoning Process of Language Models through Self-playing Game
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22920

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable reasoning abilities in various tasks such as mathematics and coding. However, recent studies indicate that even the best models lack true comprehension of their reasoning processes. In this paper, we explore how self-play can enhance the rationality of models in the reasoning process without supervision from humans or superior models. We design a Critic-Discernment Game(CDG) in which a prover first provides a solution to a given problem and is subsequently challenged by critiques of its solution. These critiques either aim to assist or mislead the prover. The objective of the prover is to maintain the correct answer when faced with misleading comments, while correcting errors in response to constructive feedback. Our experiments on tasks involving mathematical reasoning, stepwise error detection, self-correction, and long-chain reasoning demonstrate that CDG training can significantly improve the ability of well-aligned LLMs to comprehend their reasoning process.

**AI Summary:** This research explores how self-play through a Critic-Discernment Game can improve the rationality of large language models in the reasoning process without human supervision. The study shows that training models with CDG can enhance their ability to comprehend their reasoning processes, leading to better performance in tasks involving mathematical reasoning, error detection, self-correction, and long-chain reasoning. This finding is significant as it suggests a novel approach to improving the reasoning abilities of language models, potentially advancing their capabilities in various tasks.

## Hecto: Modular Sparse Experts for Adaptive and Interpretable Reasoning
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22919

**Abstract:** Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models enable conditional computation by routing inputs to specialized experts, but these experts rely on identical inductive biases, thus limiting representational diversity. This static computation pathway is inefficient for inputs that require different types of reasoning and limits specialization and interpretability. We propose Hecto, a lightweight MoE architecture that leverages architectural heterogeneity by combining a GRU expert for temporal reasoning and an FFNN expert for static abstraction under a sparse Top-1 gating mechanism. Evaluated on three reasoning benchmarks (AG News, SST-2, HotpotQA) and a regression task (STS-B), Hecto matches or closely trails homogeneous baselines in performance despite receiving isolated input representations, while achieving clear expert specialization, with each expert aligning to distinct reasoning types (temporal vs static). At larger batch sizes, Hecto exhibits improved performance, benefiting from relaxed computational constraints that allow its heterogeneous architecture to optimize more effectively. Ablation results isolate architectural diversity as the source of Hecto's stability and interpretability across diverse reasoning tasks. Overall, Hecto establishes itself as a new benchmark for conditional computation, offering a principled framework for specialized reasoning in low-resource regimes with its model strength derived from principled specialization.

**AI Summary:** The research introduces Hecto, a modular sparse expert architecture that combines a GRU expert for temporal reasoning and an FFNN expert for static abstraction under a sparse Top-1 gating mechanism. Hecto demonstrates strong performance on various reasoning benchmarks and a regression task, showing clear expert specialization and interpretability. The study highlights the importance of architectural heterogeneity in achieving improved performance and specialized reasoning in low-resource settings.

## ReasonBridge: Efficient Reasoning Transfer from Closed to Open-Source Language Models
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22865

**Abstract:** Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have revealed a significant performance gap between closed-source and open-source models, particularly in tasks requiring complex reasoning and precise instruction following. This paper introduces ReasonBridge, a methodology that efficiently transfers reasoning capabilities from powerful closed-source to open-source models through a novel hierarchical knowledge distillation framework. We develop a tailored dataset Reason1K with only 1,000 carefully curated reasoning traces emphasizing difficulty, diversity, and quality. These traces are filtered from across multiple domains using a structured multi-criteria selection algorithm. Our transfer learning approach incorporates: (1) a hierarchical distillation process capturing both strategic abstraction and tactical implementation patterns, (2) a sparse reasoning-focused adapter architecture requiring only 0.3% additional trainable parameters, and (3) a test-time compute scaling mechanism using guided inference interventions. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that ReasonBridge improves reasoning capabilities in open-source models by up to 23% on benchmark tasks, significantly narrowing the gap with closed-source models. Notably, the enhanced Qwen2.5-14B outperforms Claude-Sonnet3.5 on MATH500 and matches its performance on competition-level AIME problems. Our methodology generalizes effectively across diverse reasoning domains and model architectures, establishing a sample-efficient approach to reasoning enhancement for instruction following.

**AI Summary:** The paper introduces ReasonBridge, a methodology that transfers reasoning capabilities from closed-source to open-source language models through hierarchical knowledge distillation. By developing a tailored dataset and incorporating a hierarchical distillation process, sparse reasoning-focused adapter architecture, and test-time compute scaling mechanism, ReasonBridge improves reasoning capabilities in open-source models by up to 23% on benchmark tasks, narrowing the performance gap with closed-source models. This approach generalizes effectively across diverse reasoning domains and model architectures, offering a sample-efficient method for enhancing reasoning and instruction following in language models.

## Bridging Ethical Principles and Algorithmic Methods: An Alternative Approach for Assessing Trustworthiness in AI Systems
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22774

**Abstract:** Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology epitomizes the complex challenges posed by human-made artifacts, particularly those widely integrated into society and exert significant influence, highlighting potential benefits and their negative consequences. While other technologies may also pose substantial risks, AI's pervasive reach makes its societal effects especially profound. The complexity of AI systems, coupled with their remarkable capabilities, can lead to a reliance on technologies that operate beyond direct human oversight or understanding. To mitigate the risks that arise, several theoretical tools and guidelines have been developed, alongside efforts to create technological tools aimed at safeguarding Trustworthy AI. The guidelines take a more holistic view of the issue but fail to provide techniques for quantifying trustworthiness. Conversely, while technological tools are better at achieving such quantification, they lack a holistic perspective, focusing instead on specific aspects of Trustworthy AI. This paper aims to introduce an assessment method that combines the ethical components of Trustworthy AI with the algorithmic processes of PageRank and TrustRank. The goal is to establish an assessment framework that minimizes the subjectivity inherent in the self-assessment techniques prevalent in the field by introducing algorithmic criteria. The application of our approach indicates that a holistic assessment of an AI system's trustworthiness can be achieved by providing quantitative insights while considering the theoretical content of relevant guidelines.

**AI Summary:** This research paper addresses the challenges of assessing the trustworthiness of AI systems, which have significant societal impacts due to their widespread integration. The authors propose a method that combines ethical principles with algorithmic processes to quantify trustworthiness, aiming to provide a more holistic assessment that minimizes subjectivity. By applying their approach, the researchers demonstrate that a comprehensive evaluation of an AI system's trustworthiness can be achieved by incorporating both quantitative insights and theoretical guidelines.

**Abstract:** Modern methods for explainable machine learning are designed to describe how models map inputs to outputs--without deep consideration of how these explanations will be used in practice. This paper argues that explanations should be designed and evaluated with a specific end in mind. We describe how to formalize this end in a framework based in statistical decision theory. We show how this functionally-grounded approach can be applied across diverse use cases, such as clinical decision support, providing recourse, or debugging. We demonstrate its use to characterize the maximum "boost" in performance on a particular task that an explanation could provide an idealized decision-maker, preventing misuse due to ambiguity by forcing researchers to specify concrete use cases that can be analyzed in light of models of expected explanation use. We argue that evaluation should meld theoretical and empirical perspectives on the value of explanation, and contribute definitions that span these perspectives.

**AI Summary:** This research argues that explanations in machine learning should be designed with a specific end goal in mind, rather than just describing how models work. By formalizing this end goal in a statistical decision theory framework, researchers can better evaluate the effectiveness of explanations in practical applications such as clinical decision support or debugging. The study emphasizes the importance of considering both theoretical and empirical perspectives when evaluating the value of explanations in AI systems.

## Ludax: A GPU-Accelerated Domain Specific Language for Board Games
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22609

**Abstract:** Games have long been used as benchmarks and testing environments for research in artificial intelligence. A key step in supporting this research was the development of game description languages: frameworks that compile domain-specific code into playable and simulatable game environments, allowing researchers to generalize their algorithms and approaches across multiple games without having to manually implement each one. More recently, progress in reinforcement learning (RL) has been largely driven by advances in hardware acceleration. Libraries like JAX allow practitioners to take full advantage of cutting-edge computing hardware, often speeding up training and testing by orders of magnitude. Here, we present a synthesis of these strands of research: a domain-specific language for board games which automatically compiles into hardware-accelerated code. Our framework, Ludax, combines the generality of game description languages with the speed of modern parallel processing hardware and is designed to fit neatly into existing deep learning pipelines. We envision Ludax as a tool to help accelerate games research generally, from RL to cognitive science, by enabling rapid simulation and providing a flexible representation scheme. We present a detailed breakdown of Ludax's description language and technical notes on the compilation process, along with speed benchmarking and a demonstration of training RL agents. The Ludax framework, along with implementations of existing board games, is open-source and freely available.

## Bootstrapping Human-Like Planning via LLMs
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22604

**Abstract:** Robot end users increasingly require accessible means of specifying tasks for robots to perform. Two common end-user programming paradigms include drag-and-drop interfaces and natural language programming. Although natural language interfaces harness an intuitive form of human communication, drag-and-drop interfaces enable users to meticulously and precisely dictate the key actions of the robot's task. In this paper, we investigate the degree to which both approaches can be combined. Specifically, we construct a large language model (LLM)-based pipeline that accepts natural language as input and produces human-like action sequences as output, specified at a level of granularity that a human would produce. We then compare these generated action sequences to another dataset of hand-specified action sequences. Although our results reveal that larger models tend to outperform smaller ones in the production of human-like action sequences, smaller models nonetheless achieve satisfactory performance.

**AI Summary:** This research explores the combination of natural language programming and drag-and-drop interfaces to create a pipeline that generates human-like action sequences for robots. The study found that larger language models tend to outperform smaller ones in producing these sequences, but even smaller models can achieve satisfactory performance. This work is significant as it provides insights into how end users can effectively communicate tasks to robots in a more intuitive and precise manner.

## FADRM: Fast and Accurate Data Residual Matching for Dataset Distillation
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24125

**Abstract:** Residual connection has been extensively studied and widely applied at the model architecture level. However, its potential in the more challenging data-centric approaches remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce the concept of Data Residual Matching for the first time, leveraging data-level skip connections to facilitate data generation and mitigate data information vanishing. This approach maintains a balance between newly acquired knowledge through pixel space optimization and existing core local information identification within raw data modalities, specifically for the dataset distillation task. Furthermore, by incorporating optimization-level refinements, our method significantly improves computational efficiency, achieving superior performance while reducing training time and peak GPU memory usage by 50%. Consequently, the proposed method Fast and Accurate Data Residual Matching for Dataset Distillation (FADRM) establishes a new state-of-the-art, demonstrating substantial improvements over existing methods across multiple dataset benchmarks in both efficiency and effectiveness. For instance, with ResNet-18 as the student model and a 0.8% compression ratio on ImageNet-1K, the method achieves 47.7% test accuracy in single-model dataset distillation and 50.0% in multi-model dataset distillation, surpassing RDED by +5.7% and outperforming state-of-the-art multi-model approaches, EDC and CV-DD, by +1.4% and +4.0%. Code is available at: this https URL.

**AI Summary:** The research introduces Data Residual Matching, a novel approach that leverages data-level skip connections to improve data generation and information retention in dataset distillation tasks. The proposed method, FADRM, significantly enhances computational efficiency, achieving superior performance with reduced training time and peak GPU memory usage by 50%. FADRM outperforms existing methods across multiple dataset benchmarks, achieving a 47.7% test accuracy in single-model dataset distillation and 50.0% in multi-model dataset distillation on ImageNet-1K, surpassing previous approaches by significant margins.

## Data Uniformity Improves Training Efficiency and More, with a Convergence Framework Beyond the NTK Regime
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24120

**Abstract:** Data selection plays a crucial role in data-driven decision-making, including in large language models (LLMs), and is typically task-dependent. Properties such as data quality and diversity have been extensively studied and are known to enhance model performance. However, it remains unclear whether there exist other quantitative and general principles of data selection that can consistently improve performance, especially for complex tasks with limited prior knowledge. In this paper, we demonstrate that selecting more uniformly distributed data can improve training efficiency while enhancing performance. Specifically, we establish that more uniform (less biased) distribution leads to a larger minimum pairwise distance between data points, denoted by $h_{\min}$, and prove that a smaller $h_{\min}$ can slow down the training dynamics of gradient descent (GD). Moreover, we theoretically show that the approximation error of neural networks decreases as $h_{\min}$ increases. Our analysis introduces a convergence framework for GD beyond the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) regime, applicable to a broad class of architectures, including transformers, without requiring Lipschitz smoothness. This framework further provides theoretical justification for the use of residual connections and function compositions in deep neural architectures. In the end, we conduct comprehensive experiments for supervised fine-tuning across various settings, including different optimization strategies, model sizes, and training datasets. The results consistently demonstrate that selecting data by maximizing pairwise distance significantly accelerates training and achieves comparable or better performance in LLMs across diverse datasets. Code and Datasets are available at the link: this https URL.

**AI Summary:** This research paper explores the impact of data uniformity on training efficiency and performance in large language models (LLMs). The study shows that selecting more uniformly distributed data can improve training efficiency by increasing the minimum pairwise distance between data points, leading to slower training dynamics and decreased approximation error in neural networks. The findings introduce a convergence framework for gradient descent beyond the NTK regime, applicable to various architectures, and demonstrate that maximizing pairwise distance in data selection accelerates training and improves performance in LLMs.

## Navigating with Annealing Guidance Scale in Diffusion Space
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24108

**Abstract:** Denoising diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images conditioned on text prompts, yet their effectiveness heavily relies on careful guidance during the sampling process. Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) provides a widely used mechanism for steering generation by setting the guidance scale, which balances image quality and prompt alignment. However, the choice of the guidance scale has a critical impact on the convergence toward a visually appealing and prompt-adherent image. In this work, we propose an annealing guidance scheduler which dynamically adjusts the guidance scale over time based on the conditional noisy signal. By learning a scheduling policy, our method addresses the temperamental behavior of CFG. Empirical results demonstrate that our guidance scheduler significantly enhances image quality and alignment with the text prompt, advancing the performance of text-to-image generation. Notably, our novel scheduler requires no additional activations or memory consumption, and can seamlessly replace the common classifier-free guidance, offering an improved trade-off between prompt alignment and quality.

**AI Summary:** This research introduces an annealing guidance scheduler for denoising diffusion models, which dynamically adjusts the guidance scale during image generation based on conditional noisy signals. The proposed method improves image quality and alignment with text prompts, enhancing the performance of text-to-image generation. The novel scheduler offers a better balance between prompt alignment and image quality without requiring additional activations or memory consumption, making it a valuable advancement in AI research.

## On the Predictive Power of Representation Dispersion in Language Models
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24106

**Abstract:** We show that a language model's ability to predict text is tightly linked to the breadth of its embedding space: models that spread their contextual representations more widely tend to achieve lower perplexity. Concretely, we find that representation dispersion - the average pairwise cosine distance among hidden vectors - strongly and negatively correlates with perplexity across diverse model families (LLaMA, Qwen, and others) and domains (Wikipedia, news, scientific abstracts). Beyond illustrating this link, we show how dispersion can be leveraged for a range of practical tasks without requiring labeled data. First, measuring dispersion on unlabeled text allows us to predict downstream accuracy in new domains, offering a data-efficient tool for model selection. Next, we find that identifying layers with higher dispersion pinpoints the best representations for retrieval-based methods such as kNN-LM, bypassing exhaustive layer-by-layer searches. Finally, we integrate a simple push-away objective into training, which increases dispersion in both single-domain and cross-domain scenarios and directly improves perplexity in each.

**AI Summary:** This research demonstrates that the predictive power of language models is closely related to the dispersion of their contextual representations, with models that spread their representations more widely achieving lower perplexity. The study shows a strong negative correlation between representation dispersion and perplexity across various model families and domains. The findings suggest that measuring dispersion can be used to predict downstream accuracy in new domains, pinpoint the best representations for retrieval-based methods, and improve model training for better performance.

## Development of Hybrid Artificial Intelligence Training on Real and Synthetic Data: Benchmark on Two Mixed Training Strategies
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24093

**Abstract:** Synthetic data has emerged as a cost-effective alternative to real data for training artificial neural networks (ANN). However, the disparity between synthetic and real data results in a domain gap. That gap leads to poor performance and generalization of the trained ANN when applied to real-world scenarios. Several strategies have been developed to bridge this gap, which combine synthetic and real data, known as mixed training using hybrid datasets. While these strategies have been shown to mitigate the domain gap, a systematic evaluation of their generalizability and robustness across various tasks and architectures remains underexplored. To address this challenge, our study comprehensively analyzes two widely used mixing strategies on three prevalent architectures and three distinct hybrid datasets. From these datasets, we sample subsets with varying proportions of synthetic to real data to investigate the impact of synthetic and real components. The findings of this paper provide valuable insights into optimizing the use of synthetic data in the training process of any ANN, contributing to enhancing robustness and efficacy.

**AI Summary:** This research study explores the effectiveness of two mixed training strategies that combine real and synthetic data to train artificial neural networks. The study evaluates the generalizability and robustness of these strategies across different tasks and architectures. The findings suggest that optimizing the use of synthetic data in training can improve the performance and efficacy of artificial neural networks in real-world scenarios.
